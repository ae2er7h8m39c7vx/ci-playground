The future doesn&#39;t look bright for high rises. At the moment rents are rising in tandem with expenses squeezing the tenants.\n\nYou can still make money but you cannot buy direct from developer.

For investors, we shall see the median rental price trend in next 6-9 months whether can hold at RM4-4.5psf. Location imo is quite isolated and with the absolute rental of above RM3k even for 2 bedrooms there as so many choices out there unless parents want to send their kids to KC1.","author":"gks","pubDate":"Sun, 06 Jul 2025 22:30:29 +0800"}
