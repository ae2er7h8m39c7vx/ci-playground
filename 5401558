If can afford why loan rejected?\n\nThe the potential house buyers are not from Subang Jaya and USJ itself only, that is many pontential buyers for ownstay and investment are not stay in Subang Jaya area.\n\nMy sister invest in Sunway condo, she bought about 700k during MCO, now easily can rent out RM 3500 monthly to colleague student. I do not think USJ can have this kind of rental yield. She is not stay in Selangor , but her supplier told her this is a good deal to invest. \n\nMyself stay in puchong 15 years, and soon will move to USJ.\nIf Hype selling cheaper and bigger built up, then i will not go for subsale landed.\n\nI know many buyers of Hype and USJ resident put high expectation in this project, hope it can bring USJ house price increase.\n\nAnyhow, market and the buyers are the indicator , if the project not fully sold, only one reason, the project is overpriced, it do not means Hype do not have potential, just it need time to grow.\n\nDeveloper is selling you the future price, all their investment on amentities on facilities have to take back from buyers. If overall market is good, most of the buyers are rich, how overpriced the new project also can sell easily just like the property rally wave in 2010.\n\nMy friend family is a small developer, they also can see their project have a high loan reject cases compared to previously, worse than MCO time. The leftover buyers are getting weaker and weaker buying power, targer audience getting lesser, i guess high possibility the rich buyers bought too much property during MCO offer time, that time 1million property also can sell within one month after discounted from 1.4 million, i want to buy also too late as my agent told me booked by others during MCO time, i just need few weeks to consider after my viewing, but it taken by others so quick.","author":"chainyong","pubDate":"Tue, 10 Dec 2024 16:03:36 +0800"}
