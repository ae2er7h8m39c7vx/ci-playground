Also considering other factors such as Landed Property expansions, Covid Recovery, RTS etc<br />I&#39;m not familiar with real estate market so I&#39;m genuinely asking what would the future trend of prices. I would like to use this info to decide to buy the subsale unit for own stay and possibly renting it out in the future if I ever decide to move back to KL. I&#39;m not desperate to buy a house as I&#39;ve already owned one and fully paid in KL. But if the monthly installment+maintenance is going to be at least equal to or less than the rental then I see why not to buy one. More so, the units look well-renovated and fully furnished.</i><br /><br /><b>CONTEXT<br /></b><br />I&#39;ve relocated from KL to Setia Tropika about 1.5 years ago and been renting here since in one of the apartments called Sky Garden Residence ( another neighbouring apartment Sky Peak Residence)<br />I love this place, a lot of shops within walking distance, right at PLUS exit, and within a 15-20mins drive to all major towns in Johor Metro (Kulai, Senai, Skudai, Dato Onn, Austin, Tebrau, Southkey, JB)<br />Also relaxing 15-30mins drive to/from work in Senai.<br /><br />2022 - I rented a 3+1, 1200 sqft unit, fully furnished, 2 car park unit for rm1300. for rental renewal, my landlord increased the rental to rm1700, He told me he had to because his instalment is very high (not my problem, lol). So I moved out to another unit in the same apartment.<br />2023 - 2+1, 1000 sqft, FF, 1 car park  - rm1500.<br />2024 - looking at the rental rate for the similar unit I have now, it seems like nothing less than rm1800, so I kind of have these feeling my current landlord will up the rental rate.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been looking at the sub-sale prices and it seems to be going down since 2022. My first rented unit was going for RM480K, even when I moved out my landlord offered me a similar rate and then went down to RM450K when I ignored the 1st offer. And this was in April 2023.<br />Currently, I&#39;ve been seeing these units going for RM420K. 2+1 units (similar to the one I&#39;m renting now) are going for RM380K. Neighbouring apartment Sky Peak seeing a similar trend, though it&#39;s slightly more expensive than Sky Garden.<br /><br /><b>Rental rates are going up but subsale prices are going down? Why?</b>[I]<br /><br />Now, I just saw that SP Setia going to build another apartment right between Sky Garden and Sky Peak. I checked with them, the max price will be RM550K for 3-bedroom units 850sqft.<br />There is another apartment across the PLUS highway called D&#39;Secret Garden 2 by KSL that is under construction, right next to 6-year-old D&#39;Secret Garden 1.","author":"Kakistok","pubDate":"Sun, 10 Dec 2023 15:07:37 +0800"}

Police came as well. I found out that it was a domestic abuse case going on in the family. They gaduh until husband was pointing a knife at the wife&#39;s neck. This is what i heard from the wife. Currently, the husband is on the loose, wife and children are at hospital. Apparently, this husband (second husband) has history of abusing the wife, and this is the first time the wife reporting on her husband.<br /><br />Thank god the access card and keys are with the wife. Tenancy agreement is signed under the husband&#39;s name and the agreement is with the wife as well. She wants to change the agreement to her name. I have the rental and utilities deposit, but the deposit is transferred to me via the husband&#39;s account. I am so damn lost now, please enlighten me fellow sifus, what can i do as a landlord?","author":"dex3ter","pubDate":"Fri, 22 Dec 2023 09:24:26 +0800"}
