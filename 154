Also considering other factors such as Landed Property expansions, Covid Recovery, RTS etc<br />I&#39;m not familiar with real estate market so I&#39;m genuinely asking what would the future trend of prices. I would like to use this info to decide to buy the subsale unit for own stay and possibly renting it out in the future if I ever decide to move back to KL. I&#39;m not desperate to buy a house as I&#39;ve already owned one and fully paid in KL. But if the monthly installment+maintenance is going to be at least equal to or less than the rental then I see why not to buy one. More so, the units look well-renovated and fully furnished.</i><br /><br /><b>CONTEXT<br /></b><br />I&#39;ve relocated from KL to Setia Tropika about 1.5 years ago and been renting here since in one of the apartments called Sky Garden Residence ( another neighbouring apartment Sky Peak Residence)<br />I love this place, a lot of shops within walking distance, right at PLUS exit, and within a 15-20mins drive to all major towns in Johor Metro (Kulai, Senai, Skudai, Dato Onn, Austin, Tebrau, Southkey, JB)<br />Also relaxing 15-30mins drive to/from work in Senai.<br /><br />2022 - I rented a 3+1, 1200 sqft unit, fully furnished, 2 car park unit for rm1300. for rental renewal, my landlord increased the rental to rm1700, He told me he had to because his instalment is very high (not my problem, lol). So I moved out to another unit in the same apartment.<br />2023 - 2+1, 1000 sqft, FF, 1 car park  - rm1500.<br />2024 - looking at the rental rate for the similar unit I have now, it seems like nothing less than rm1800, so I kind of have these feeling my current landlord will up the rental rate.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been looking at the sub-sale prices and it seems to be going down since 2022. My first rented unit was going for RM480K, even when I moved out my landlord offered me a similar rate and then went down to RM450K when I ignored the 1st offer. And this was in April 2023.<br />Currently, I&#39;ve been seeing these units going for RM420K. 2+1 units (similar to the one I&#39;m renting now) are going for RM380K. Neighbouring apartment Sky Peak seeing a similar trend, though it&#39;s slightly more expensive than Sky Garden.<br /><br /><b>Rental rates are going up but subsale prices are going down? Why?</b>[I]<br /><br />Now, I just saw that SP Setia going to build another apartment right between Sky Garden and Sky Peak. I checked with them, the max price will be RM550K for 3-bedroom units 850sqft.<br />There is another apartment across the PLUS highway called D&#39;Secret Garden 2 by KSL that is under construction, right next to 6-year-old D&#39;Secret Garden 1.","author":"Kakistok","pubDate":"Sun, 10 Dec 2023 15:07:37 +0800"}

Apparently, this husband (second husband) has history of abusing the wife, and this is the first time the wife reporting on her husband.<br /><br />Thank god the access card and keys are with the wife. Tenancy agreement is signed under the husband&#39;s name and the agreement is with the wife as well. She wants to change the agreement to her name. I have the rental and utilities deposit, but the deposit is transferred to me via the husband&#39;s account.

Business costs, political stability, and pro-business policies are the factors to take into account,&quot; he told NST Property.\n\n  Tan said that Mah Sing may be able to generate positive sales from its proposed development, given that the land is in an excellent location close to Lima Kedai, where there is a decent mix of low- to high-income groups.\n\n\n  Lima Kedai is a crucial transit hub for those using the Second Link Motorway.\n\n  According to Tan, there are numerous employment hubs in and near Pulai, including Southern Industrial Logistics and Clusters (SiLC), Nusajaya Tech Park, Tanjung Bin, and the Port of Tanjung Pelepas, which are increasing demand for houses.\n\n\n  Mah Sing paid RM 76.09 million, or RM23 per square foot (psf), for 30.63 hectares   (  75.68 acres)    in Pulai to expand its M-series.\n\n  It plans to introduce M Tiara, a community of \n\ndouble-storey cluster homes (32&#39;x70&#39;/75&#39;) and\n\n2240 sq ft\n\n\n double-storey terraced homes (20&#39;/22&#39;x70&#39;), \n\n\n1400 sq ft\n\n\nwith a gross development value (GDV) of RM480 million.\n\n\n\n\n  According to Mah Sing&#39;s statement yesterday, the most affordable residential units are anticipated to cost RM624,800.\n\n\nSo cheap ???????\n\n\n\n  The land acquisition is in line with Mah Sing&#39;s strategy of quick turnaround, as registration of interest is expected to be in the first half of 2024.\n\n  Tan said that the stated purchase price was reasonable.\n\n  &quot;Recent sales in Pulai ranged from RM20 to RM25 psf. We believe that the pricing of RM23 psf is suitable for Mah Sing to create its M-series,&quot; he added.\n\n  Analysts are particularly optimistic about Mah Sing&#39;s purchase of land in Pulai since it will allow the company to extend its M-series of affordable housing projects.\n\n  According to MIDF Research, the land cost to GDV is appealing at 16 per cent of the project&#39;s overall value.\n\n  Additionally, it anticipates a minimal impact on the balance sheet. \n\n  &quot;Post-acquisition, we estimate net gearing to increase marginally to 0.22 times from 0.2 times in the first quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, we do not foresee earnings impact in the near term as the project is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.\n\nHence, we make no changes to our earnings forecast,&quot; MIDF said in a note.\n\n  The research house has maintained its &quot;Buy&quot; call on Mah Sing with an unchanged target price of 75 sen.\n\n  It continues to be optimistic about Mah Sing, as it believes that new sales prospects for Mah Sing will be driven by the introduction of properties at reasonable prices. \n\n  The strategic location and affordable purchase price of the planned acquisition have TA Securities feeling optimistic as well. \n\n  The research firm said that in accordance with the anticipated GDV of RM480 million, the land cost accounts for 15.9 per cent  of the entire development value.\n\n  &quot;As the land cost to GDV ratio comes below the general rule of thumb of 20 per cent, we deem the acquisition price reasonable,&quot; it said.\n\n  The positive take-up rate of 85–95 per cent for Mah Sing&#39;s new launches in the first quarter of 2023, demonstrates the persistent demand for affordable housing in urban areas, according to TA Securities.\n\n<img src='https://i.ibb.co/M6TbQLQ/Screenshot-20240121-230514-Chrome.jpg' border='0' alt='user posted image' />","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Sun, 21 Jan 2024 23:10:31 +0800"}

The road in front of our house is actually one-way road (enough to fit one car), but because they used my driveway, so it become two-way (enough for two cars).\n\nBecause it has been like this for many years, so I don&#39;t think I can take it back to make fence, and it is not nice to neighbours too. So, can I get some compensation from Government as that piece of land is belong to my family and now has been used as public road?\n\nAny input are welcome, thanks a lot&#33;","author":"gsstars","pubDate":"Wed, 17 Jan 2024 17:02:12 +0800"}

Business costs, political stability, and pro-business policies are the factors to take into account,&quot; he told NST Property.\n\n  Tan said that Mah Sing may be able to generate positive sales from its proposed development, given that the land is in an excellent location close to Lima Kedai, where there is a decent mix of low- to high-income groups.\n\n\n  Lima Kedai is a crucial transit hub for those using the Second Link Motorway.\n\n  According to Tan, there are numerous employment hubs in and near Pulai, including Southern Industrial Logistics and Clusters (SiLC), Nusajaya Tech Park, Tanjung Bin, and the Port of Tanjung Pelepas, which are increasing demand for houses.\n\n\n  Mah Sing paid RM 76.09 million, or RM23 per square foot (psf), for 30.63 hectares   (  75.68 acres)    in Pulai to expand its M-series.\n\n  It plans to introduce M Tiara, a community of \n\ndouble-storey cluster homes (32&#39;x70&#39;/75&#39;) and\n\n2240 sq ft\n\n\n double-storey terraced homes (20&#39;/22&#39;x70&#39;), \n\n\n1400 sq ft\n\n\nwith a gross development value (GDV) of RM480 million.\n\n\n\n\n  According to Mah Sing&#39;s statement yesterday, the most affordable residential units are anticipated to cost RM624,800.\n\n\nSo cheap ???????\n\n\n\n  The land acquisition is in line with Mah Sing&#39;s strategy of quick turnaround, as registration of interest is expected to be in the first half of 2024.\n\n  Tan said that the stated purchase price was reasonable.\n\n  &quot;Recent sales in Pulai ranged from RM20 to RM25 psf. We believe that the pricing of RM23 psf is suitable for Mah Sing to create its M-series,&quot; he added.\n\n  Analysts are particularly optimistic about Mah Sing&#39;s purchase of land in Pulai since it will allow the company to extend its M-series of affordable housing projects.\n\n  According to MIDF Research, the land cost to GDV is appealing at 16 per cent of the project&#39;s overall value.\n\n  Additionally, it anticipates a minimal impact on the balance sheet. \n\n  &quot;Post-acquisition, we estimate net gearing to increase marginally to 0.22 times from 0.2 times in the first quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, we do not foresee earnings impact in the near term as the project is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.\n\nHence, we make no changes to our earnings forecast,&quot; MIDF said in a note.\n\n  The research house has maintained its &quot;Buy&quot; call on Mah Sing with an unchanged target price of 75 sen.\n\n  It continues to be optimistic about Mah Sing, as it believes that new sales prospects for Mah Sing will be driven by the introduction of properties at reasonable prices. \n\n  The strategic location and affordable purchase price of the planned acquisition have TA Securities feeling optimistic as well. \n\n  The research firm said that in accordance with the anticipated GDV of RM480 million, the land cost accounts for 15.9 per cent  of the entire development value.\n\n  &quot;As the land cost to GDV ratio comes below the general rule of thumb of 20 per cent, we deem the acquisition price reasonable,&quot; it said.\n\n  The positive take-up rate of 85–95 per cent for Mah Sing&#39;s new launches in the first quarter of 2023, demonstrates the persistent demand for affordable housing in urban areas, according to TA Securities.","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Sun, 21 Jan 2024 23:10:31 +0800"}

For example, some of their land is located in matured areas such as [Bandar] Kinrara [in Puchong, Selangor], we want to sweat the land more,” Khor told a news conference after the group’s extraordinary general meeting (EGM) yesterday.\n\n“This would be our area of focus for the next few months and once we get the plans in place, we will push ahead with the execution. So, the first half of 2018 would be [about] planning and the second half through  2019 would see us rolling out a lot of projects,” he added.\n\nS P Setia on June 22 entered into a conditional share purchase agreement to acquire I&amp;P from PNB for RM3.65 billion. In conjunction with the acquisitions, the group proposed a fundraising exercise to raise up to RM3.6 billion.\n\nEarlier at the EGM, S P Setia shareholders gave the nod for the acquisition and fundraising exercise.\n\nAs for manpower allocation after the acquisition, Khor said a reorganisation structure in terms of job allocation had already been put in place for 2018.\n\n“From the beginning of next year, certain units will be spearheaded by the I&amp;P team and certain units by the S P Setia team, with staff of I&amp;P coming in for I&amp;P projects and certain I&amp;P staff will be incorporated into the main Setia team. \n\nAll these have been discussed, thought through and ready for implementation,” he added.\n\nS P Setia shareholders also gave the nod for the group’s acquisition of a 342.5-acre piece of land in Bangi, Selangor from Seriemas Development Sdn Bhd, an indirect subsidiary of PNB, for RM447.58 million. For clarity, the Bangi land is already included in the group’s 9,728 acres of land bank.\n\nThe proposed development in Bangi is expected to generate an estimated gross development value of RM2.74 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Khor said it is too early to discuss the group’s sales target for 2018.\n\n“It is too early to say as we are focusing on achieving this year’s sales target of RM4 billion, but we will not do less than this year,” he said. For the first nine months of this year, S P Setia has secured RM2.82 billion in sales.\n\nCurrently, S P Setia has a total unbilled sales of RM7.05 billion, anchored by 31 ongoing projects.\n\nOn the outlook for the property market, Khor believes it will pick up in 2018.\n\n“Whether it’s a very slow or strong pickup that depends on whether there are catalysts to drive the market.\n\n“A lot of people are saying that [property purchases] have been held back due to the [imminent] elections and after elections there could be a strong pickup. I think these are the catalysts or factors affecting the market,” he said.\n\n“At the moment, [the market] is quite flat, but every time we launch any landed properties with mid-range [pricing] the demand is there,” added Khor.\n\nS P Setia shares closed 13 sen or 3.81% higher at RM3.54 yesterday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM10.28 billion.\n\n\n","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Tue, 13 Feb 2024 09:54:58 +0800"}

He added that rentals were currently higher than the pre-Covid period.\n\n&quot;Last year and this year we saw an increase in rental rates. During MCO the rental rate was low but it is picking up.

Located on high altitude, residents enjoy the close proximity to Johor Bahru’s new premier business and leisure cities ie. Pandan, Tebrau, Ulu Tiram and Plentong, thanks to the well developed access and highways.\n\nA popular choice within the Johor Bahru - Kota Tinggi corridor, offers limitless opportunities in terms of job availability, education, medical services, shopping and recreations. \n\n\nNumerous bus and taxi services run their operations along the corridor, making public transportation a popular alternative. \n\n\nMalaysia’s ‘giants’ in retail industry such as  Lotus&#39;s and Mydin hypermarkets can be found nearby Taman Pelangi Indah, while SONG MART and Pandan wet markets are traditionally a popular choice for locals.\n\n\nLotus&#39;s Plentong\nLot 34, Jalan Masai, Batu 10, Masai, 81750 Johor Bahru\n\n\n\nAEON Tebrau City which hosted JUSCO department store is a must for those seeking retail and entertainment therapy as it also offers a 10-hall Cineplex and a popular karaoke joint. \n\nClose by, Regency Specialist Hospital and Hospital Sultan Ismail offer the best in service and value when it comes to medical care. Education is another hub-in-the making with schools and colleges efficiently linked within the area. \n\nSunway College which started its operation in year 2006, is a top choice for students who wish to further their education closer to home.\n\n\nTwo recreational lakes totaling more than 40 acres act as the green oasis and meeting points for many residents; it’s a place where children run freely and community lifestyle are showcased at its best.\n\n\n\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: S P Setia Bhd, which will get a 78% land bank boost from its acquisition of I&amp;P Group Sdn Bhd from Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB), is in no rush to start developing the new sites.\n\nS P Setia president and chief executive officer Datuk Khor Chap Jen said it will not be developing the land aggressively in the first half of 2018, but instead will meticulously plan its developments in order to add value.\n\n\n\nThe country’s biggest listed developer by sales is set to increase its land bank in the Klang Valley and Johor from 5,452 acres (2,206.34ha) to 9,728 acres,\n\n\n following the completion of its acquisition of I&amp;P by year end — which will propel it to become the country’s third largest property developer by land bank\n\n after Sime Darby Property Bhd\n and\n UEM Sunrise Bhd.\n\n\n\n“The first thing that we will do is to review all the plans that they (I&amp;P) have, and we definitely want to add value ... we think we can add more value to their land. For example, some of their land is located in matured areas such as [Bandar] Kinrara [in Puchong, Selangor], we want to sweat the land more,” Khor told a news conference after the group’s extraordinary general meeting (EGM) yesterday.\n\n“This would be our area of focus for the next few months and once we get the plans in place, we will push ahead with the execution. So, the first half of 2018 would be [about] planning and the second half through  2019 would see us rolling out a lot of projects,” he added.\n\nS P Setia on June 22 entered into a conditional share purchase agreement to acquire I&amp;P from PNB for RM3.65 billion. In conjunction with the acquisitions, the group proposed a fundraising exercise to raise up to RM3.6 billion.\n\nEarlier at the EGM, S P Setia shareholders gave the nod for the acquisition and fundraising exercise.\n\nAs for manpower allocation after the acquisition, Khor said a reorganisation structure in terms of job allocation had already been put in place for 2018.\n\n“From the beginning of next year, certain units will be spearheaded by the I&amp;P team and certain units by the S P Setia team, with staff of I&amp;P coming in for I&amp;P projects and certain I&amp;P staff will be incorporated into the main Setia team. \n\nAll these have been discussed, thought through and ready for implementation,” he added.\n\nS P Setia shareholders also gave the nod for the group’s acquisition of a 342.5-acre piece of land in Bangi, Selangor from Seriemas Development Sdn Bhd, an indirect subsidiary of PNB, for RM447.58 million. For clarity, the Bangi land is already included in the group’s 9,728 acres of land bank.\n\nThe proposed development in Bangi is expected to generate an estimated gross development value of RM2.74 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Khor said it is too early to discuss the group’s sales target for 2018.\n\n“It is too early to say as we are focusing on achieving this year’s sales target of RM4 billion, but we will not do less than this year,” he said. For the first nine months of this year, S P Setia has secured RM2.82 billion in sales.\n\nCurrently, S P Setia has a total unbilled sales of RM7.05 billion, anchored by 31 ongoing projects.\n\nOn the outlook for the property market, Khor believes it will pick up in 2018.\n\n“Whether it’s a very slow or strong pickup that depends on whether there are catalysts to drive the market.\n\n“A lot of people are saying that [property purchases] have been held back due to the [imminent] elections and after elections there could be a strong pickup. I think these are the catalysts or factors affecting the market,” he said.\n\n“At the moment, [the market] is quite flat, but every time we launch any landed properties with mid-range [pricing] the demand is there,” added Khor.\n\nS P Setia shares closed 13 sen or 3.81% higher at RM3.54 yesterday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM10.28 billion.","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Tue, 13 Feb 2024 09:54:58 +0800"}

Located on high altitude, residents enjoy the close proximity to Johor Bahru’s new premier business and leisure cities ie. Pandan, Tebrau, Ulu Tiram and Plentong, thanks to the well developed access and highways.\n\nA popular choice within the Johor Bahru - Kota Tinggi corridor, offers limitless opportunities in terms of job availability, education, medical services, shopping and recreations. \n\n\nNumerous bus and taxi services run their operations along the corridor, making public transportation a popular alternative. \n\n\nMalaysia’s ‘giants’ in retail industry such as  Lotus&#39;s and Mydin hypermarkets can be found nearby Taman Pelangi Indah, while SONG MART and Pandan wet markets are traditionally a popular choice for locals.\n\n\nLotus&#39;s Plentong\nLot 34, Jalan Masai, Batu 10, Masai, 81750 Johor Bahru\n\n\n\nAEON Tebrau City which hosted JUSCO department store is a must for those seeking retail and entertainment therapy as it also offers a 10-hall Cineplex and a popular karaoke joint. \n\nClose by, Regency Specialist Hospital and Hospital Sultan Ismail offer the best in service and value when it comes to medical care. Education is another hub-in-the making with schools and colleges efficiently linked within the area. \n\nSunway College which started its operation in year 2006, is a top choice for students who wish to further their education closer to home.\n\n\nTwo recreational lakes totaling more than 40 acres act as the green oasis and meeting points for many residents; it’s a place where children run freely and community lifestyle are showcased at its best.\n\n\n\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: S P Setia Bhd, which will get a 78% land bank boost from its acquisition of I&amp;P Group Sdn Bhd from Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB), is in no rush to start developing the new sites.\n\nS P Setia president and chief executive officer Datuk Khor Chap Jen said it will not be developing the land aggressively in the first half of 2018, but instead will meticulously plan its developments in order to add value.\n\n\n\nThe country’s biggest listed developer by sales is set to increase its land bank in the Klang Valley and Johor from 5,452 acres (2,206.34ha) to 9,728 acres,\n\n\n following the completion of its acquisition of I&amp;P by year end — which will propel it to become the country’s third largest property developer by land bank\n\n after Sime Darby Property Bhd\n and\n UEM Sunrise Bhd.\n\n\n\n“The first thing that we will do is to review all the plans that they (I&amp;P) have, and we definitely want to add value ... we think we can add more value to their land. For example, some of their land is located in matured areas such as [Bandar] Kinrara [in Puchong, Selangor], we want to sweat the land more,” Khor told a news conference after the group’s extraordinary general meeting (EGM) yesterday.\n\n“This would be our area of focus for the next few months and once we get the plans in place, we will push ahead with the execution. So, the first half of 2018 would be [about] planning and the second half through  2019 would see us rolling out a lot of projects,” he added.\n\nS P Setia on June 22 entered into a conditional share purchase agreement to acquire I&amp;P from PNB for RM3.65 billion. In conjunction with the acquisitions, the group proposed a fundraising exercise to raise up to RM3.6 billion.\n\nEarlier at the EGM, S P Setia shareholders gave the nod for the acquisition and fundraising exercise.\n\nAs for manpower allocation after the acquisition, Khor said a reorganisation structure in terms of job allocation had already been put in place for 2018.\n\n“From the beginning of next year, certain units will be spearheaded by the I&amp;P team and certain units by the S P Setia team, with staff of I&amp;P coming in for I&amp;P projects and certain I&amp;P staff will be incorporated into the main Setia team. \n\nAll these have been discussed, thought through and ready for implementation,” he added.\n\nS P Setia shareholders also gave the nod for the group’s acquisition of a 342.5-acre piece of land in Bangi, Selangor from Seriemas Development Sdn Bhd, an indirect subsidiary of PNB, for RM447.58 million. For clarity, the Bangi land is already included in the group’s 9,728 acres of land bank.\n\nThe proposed development in Bangi is expected to generate an estimated gross development value of RM2.74 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Khor said it is too early to discuss the group’s sales target for 2018.\n\n“It is too early to say as we are focusing on achieving this year’s sales target of RM4 billion, but we will not do less than this year,” he said. For the first nine months of this year, S P Setia has secured RM2.82 billion in sales.\n\nCurrently, S P Setia has a total unbilled sales of RM7.05 billion, anchored by 31 ongoing projects.\n\nOn the outlook for the property market, Khor believes it will pick up in 2018.\n\n“Whether it’s a very slow or strong pickup that depends on whether there are catalysts to drive the market.\n\n“A lot of people are saying that [property purchases] have been held back due to the [imminent] elections and after elections there could be a strong pickup. I think these are the catalysts or factors affecting the market,” he said.\n\n“At the moment, [the market] is quite flat, but every time we launch any landed properties with mid-range [pricing] the demand is there,” added Khor.\n\nS P Setia shares closed 13 sen or 3.81% higher at RM3.54 yesterday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM10.28 billion.","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Tue, 13 Feb 2024 09:54:58 +0800"}

Located on high altitude, residents enjoy the close proximity to Johor Bahru’s new premier business and leisure cities ie. Pandan, Tebrau, Ulu Tiram and Plentong, thanks to the well developed access and highways.\n\nA popular choice within the Johor Bahru - Kota Tinggi corridor, offers limitless opportunities in terms of job availability, education, medical services, shopping and recreations. \n\n\nNumerous bus and taxi services run their operations along the corridor, making public transportation a popular alternative. \n\n\nMalaysia’s ‘giants’ in retail industry such as  Lotus&#39;s and Mydin hypermarkets can be found nearby Taman Pelangi Indah, while SONG MART and Pandan wet markets are traditionally a popular choice for locals.\n\n\nLotus&#39;s Plentong\nLot 34, Jalan Masai, Batu 10, Masai, 81750 Johor Bahru\n\n\n\nAEON Tebrau City which hosted JUSCO department store is a must for those seeking retail and entertainment therapy as it also offers a 10-hall Cineplex and a popular karaoke joint. \n\nClose by, Regency Specialist Hospital and Hospital Sultan Ismail offer the best in service and value when it comes to medical care. Education is another hub-in-the making with schools and colleges efficiently linked within the area. \n\nSunway College which started its operation in year 2006, is a top choice for students who wish to further their education closer to home.\n\n\nTwo recreational lakes totaling more than 40 acres act as the green oasis and meeting points for many residents; it’s a place where children run freely and community lifestyle are showcased at its best.\n\n\n\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: S P Setia Bhd, which will get a 78% land bank boost from its acquisition of I&amp;P Group Sdn Bhd from Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB), is in no rush to start developing the new sites.\n\nS P Setia president and chief executive officer Datuk Khor Chap Jen said it will not be developing the land aggressively in the first half of 2018, but instead will meticulously plan its developments in order to add value.\n\n\n\nThe country’s biggest listed developer by sales is set to increase its land bank in the Klang Valley and Johor from 5,452 acres (2,206.34ha) to 9,728 acres,\n\n\n following the completion of its acquisition of I&amp;P by year end — which will propel it to become the country’s third largest property developer by land bank\n\n after Sime Darby Property Bhd\n and\n UEM Sunrise Bhd.\n\n\n\n“The first thing that we will do is to review all the plans that they (I&amp;P) have, and we definitely want to add value ... we think we can add more value to their land. For example, some of their land is located in matured areas such as [Bandar] Kinrara [in Puchong, Selangor], we want to sweat the land more,” Khor told a news conference after the group’s extraordinary general meeting (EGM) yesterday.\n\n“This would be our area of focus for the next few months and once we get the plans in place, we will push ahead with the execution. So, the first half of 2018 would be [about] planning and the second half through  2019 would see us rolling out a lot of projects,” he added.\n\nS P Setia on June 22 entered into a conditional share purchase agreement to acquire I&amp;P from PNB for RM3.65 billion. In conjunction with the acquisitions, the group proposed a fundraising exercise to raise up to RM3.6 billion.\n\nEarlier at the EGM, S P Setia shareholders gave the nod for the acquisition and fundraising exercise.\n\nAs for manpower allocation after the acquisition, Khor said a reorganisation structure in terms of job allocation had already been put in place for 2018.\n\n“From the beginning of next year, certain units will be spearheaded by the I&amp;P team and certain units by the S P Setia team, with staff of I&amp;P coming in for I&amp;P projects and certain I&amp;P staff will be incorporated into the main Setia team. \n\nAll these have been discussed, thought through and ready for implementation,” he added.\n\nS P Setia shareholders also gave the nod for the group’s acquisition of a 342.5-acre piece of land in Bangi, Selangor from Seriemas Development Sdn Bhd, an indirect subsidiary of PNB, for RM447.58 million. For clarity, the Bangi land is already included in the group’s 9,728 acres of land bank.\n\nThe proposed development in Bangi is expected to generate an estimated gross development value of RM2.74 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Khor said it is too early to discuss the group’s sales target for 2018.\n\n“It is too early to say as we are focusing on achieving this year’s sales target of RM4 billion, but we will not do less than this year,” he said. For the first nine months of this year, S P Setia has secured RM2.82 billion in sales.\n\nCurrently, S P Setia has a total unbilled sales of RM7.05 billion, anchored by 31 ongoing projects.\n\nOn the outlook for the property market, Khor believes it will pick up in 2018.\n\n“Whether it’s a very slow or strong pickup that depends on whether there are catalysts to drive the market.\n\n“A lot of people are saying that [property purchases] have been held back due to the [imminent] elections and after elections there could be a strong pickup. I think these are the catalysts or factors affecting the market,” he said.\n\n“At the moment, [the market] is quite flat, but every time we launch any landed properties with mid-range [pricing] the demand is there,” added Khor.\n\nS P Setia shares closed 13 sen or 3.81% higher at RM3.54 yesterday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM10.28 billion.","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Tue, 13 Feb 2024 09:54:58 +0800"}

It is also in line with the group&#39;s wider strategy of continuing to acquire strategically located prime land in Johor Bahru, it said.\n\nThe company said site was near other matured developments such\n\n as Taman Mount Austin and Taman Daya \n\nand hence also offered several important advantages, in particular the sustained potential demand from upgraders in the area desiring to move-up to larger, newer and better designed houses.\n\n“Another source of demand is from young adults planning to move out of their parents&#39; homes without having to leave the comforts of the local support network that they have grown accustomed to.\n\n“Further, the existing population of the surrounding matured housing projects will also form the core catchment area for the proposed development&#39;s commercial components,” it said.\n\nS P Setia was confident that the proposed development of mixed residential and commercial project on the land would be well received, and contribute positively to its future earnings and cash flow.\n\n“The proposed development will also ensure S P Setia&#39;s continuing presence and efforts in building residential properties in Johor,” it said.\n\n\n\n\n\nS P Setia acquires land in Johor\nJanuary 28, 2011 \n\n\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: Top property developer S P Setia Bhd is purchasing a 265.7 acre piece of land in Johor Bahru for RM125.78 million, it told the local bourse on Friday, Jan 28.\n\nIts unit Setia Indah Sdn Bhd had on the same day entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement with Kenyalang Property Development Sdn Bhd for the acquisition, which will be developed into a mixed residential development project.\n\n&quot;The said land is situated in the Tebrau corridor, which is a fast growing area in Johor given increased development activities and new property launches as housing demand has spilled over from the congested Johor Bahru city to this corridor. The group&#39;s matured Setia Indah Johor township is located approximately 10 minutes from the land,&quot; it added.\n\nThe amount is calculated at the rate of RM11 psf based on a net land of 262.519 acres after excluding approximately 3.2 acres reserved for water pipeline.\n\nIn a separate media statement, its president and CEO Tan Sri Liew Kee Sin said the group is looking forward to taking advantage of the exciting happenings in the Iskandar Malaysia region to further broaden and deepen its already dominant position in the state, with about 1,500 acres of undeveloped landbank in Johor Bahru following this latest acquisition.\n\nThe developer believes that the robust Singapore economy will see a more sustainable rate of growth of 4% to 6% and create positive spill-over effects for Johor Bahru.\n\n&quot;The acquisition is in-line with the group&#39;s strategy to continue to grow and strengthen its presence in Johor Bahru. The land&#39;s location within the Tebrau corridor where the S P Setia has established a strong following enables it to tap further into the sustained potential demand from upgraders comprised within the group&#39;s own customer base and the surrounding matured residential areas,&quot; he added.\n\nS P Setia has been present in Johor for more than 13 years and has carved a solid reputation for delivering quality homes in its four ongoing projects, namely Bukit Indah Johor, Setia Indah Johor, Setia Tropika and Setia Eco Gardens.\n\nThe group&#39;s long presence and continuous efforts to create value for all its integrated townships in Johor have resulted in numerous local and international awards along with consistently strong sales.\n\n\n\n\n[UPDATE] S P Setia strengthens presence in Johor, to launch properties with a total GDV of &#036;182 mil this year\n\n4 June 2023\n\n\nAn artist’s impression of the entrance to Callista Green in Taman Rinting (Photo: S P Setia)\n\nSINGAPORE (EDGEPROP) - Johor’s real estate market appears to be on an upward trajectory, prompting developers to launch more projects this financial year, according to industry experts.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAttesting to the optimistic outlook, S P Setia Bhd plans to grow its presence in the southern region with a slew of launches worth a total gross development value (GDV) of RM618.76 million (&#036;182 million) in FY2023.\n\nThe property group has been making its mark in Johor with its diversified high-rises, townships, mixed-use developments and commercial centres since 1995. As at December 2022, the group had 8,489.16 acres of land bank in the state with a total GDV of about RM28.1 billion.\n\nIts well-known projects there include nine masterplan townships and developments in Bukit Indah in Taman Bukit Indah, Iskandar Puteri; Setia Eco Cascadia in Tebrau; Setia Eco Gardens in Gelang Patah; Setia Indah Johor; Setia Tropika; Setia Business Park I and Setia Business Park II; Taman Perling; Taman Rinting; Taman Pelangi; Taman Pelangi Indah I; Taman Industri Jaya; Mukim Tanjung Kupang in Iskandar Puteri; and Mukim Serkat in Pontian.\n\n“There has been a tremendous change [in the southern region’s land- scape] since we entered the Johor market with Bukit Indah,” recalls its divisional general manager Saniman Amat Yusof, who himself is a resident of Bukit Indah.\n\n\n\nSaniman: We are focused on rolling out our bread- and-butter products in the region, which are mainly landed residential properties (Photo: S P Setia) \n\n“Back then, especially in the early 2000s, things were very different, and values have since appreciated ... prices were roughly RM200,000 for landed homes back then but now, they are priced at RM700,000 [on average]. We didn’t have good internet connectivity, had limited accessibility [but are now connected to a network of highways, including the Eastern Dispersal Link (EDL), Lebuhraya Persisiran Pantai (Coastal Highway), PLUS Expressway and the Second Link Expressway]. It was not as vibrant as it is today in terms of retailers and facilities,” he tells The Edge Malaysia during a Microsoft Teams meeting.\n\n“I hardly leave the township for anything else because everything is easily available here. My family is quite pleased as well and my children’s schools are nearby. We would like our customers in Johor to experience the same level of convenience at all our townships, aligning with our tagline of ‘live, learn, work, play’.”\n\nIn 1995, S P Setia acquired 900 acres of land from UEM Land (now UEM Sunrise Bhd) and developed it into a planned housing estate. In 2000, the group bought another 300 acres of land for development purposes. Previously an oil palm estate, Bukit Indah has grown into a vibrant and green settlement spanning 1,521 acres with a total GDV of RM5.2 billion. The township is now home to about 60,000 people, who live in more than 10,000 houses.\n\n“This was our first project in Johor, even before Iskandar Malaysia was mooted. It proceeded to win the Johor State Landscape Award 2001, the National Landscape Competition 2001 and the Best National Landscape Award 2005. Bukit Indah is strategically located in Iskandar Malaysia and is only minutes away from Johor Baru,” says Saniman.\n\nThe property group plans to build on this momentum and establish more developments in their masterplans in the southern region over the short and long term.\n\nSaniman says S P Setia’s plans to roll out a few projects in FY2023, namely Adonis at Taman Rinting; Hazelton and Clymer at Setia Eco Cascadia; Palmwood at Taman Pelangi Indah; and Maple &amp; Pine (Phase 2) at Setia Eco Gardens.\n\n\n\nAn artist’s impression of Adonis in Taman Rinting (Photo: S P Setia)\n\n\nAppearing sanguine about the upcoming launches in the southern region, Saniman elaborates on the group’s overall plans. “We are focused on rolling out our bread-and-butter products in the region, which are mainly landed residential properties [priced from RM600,000], and we are confident they will perform well.\n\n\n The key is to price the products well, even though we are mindful of the rising construction costs [which remains a challenge] and other market factors.”\n\nHe adds that a way to overcome this is by simplifying the design of the units. “We have been injecting more eco-themed, sustainable elements and smart home features, and even allocated spaces for solar panels, rather than adding more elements that are costly. There are alternative smart ways to enhance a home while minimising the overall cost and maintenance.\n\n“So far this year, we have launched cluster homes, Calliandra in Setia Tropika; \n\n\nwe also plan to launch Longevia at the same township next month. \n\nThe response has been really good as they are fully booked. We have also launched super link terraced units in Taman Pelangi Indah, which are also fully booked, followed by Clymer and Hazelton (Phase 2) in February and more units in Taman Rinting.”(  81750 Masai Johor)\n\n\nSaniman also mentions details of upcoming launches, particularly Adonis, which is sprawled on an 831-acre parcel in Taman Rinting and comprises two-storey terraced houses and semi-detached homes.\n\n“We are launching 60 units of Desiran 2 (20ft by 70ft) at Adonis, which have a total GDV of RM43 million, in October. The units will be priced from RM720,000,” he says.\n\n“We will launch 2-storey terraced homes Clymer and Hazelton (specifically subphase Alluvia Phase 3 and Phase 4) in Setia Eco Cascadia, which will account for a total GDV of RM147 million, in 1Q2024. The units will be 20ft by 70ft and 22ft by 70ft, and priced from RM754,800.”\n\nIn September, S P Setia will unveil Palmwood — specifically Palmwood 2 (51 units) — in Taman Pelangi Indah that will have a total GDV of RM45 million. The 28ft by 65ft units will be priced from RM845,200.\n\n“We will also launch Maple and Pine (Phase 2) in Setia Eco Gardens. They will comprise 124 units on 765 acres of land and have a total GDVof RM69 million. Maple 2 [20ft by 65ft] and Pine 2 [18ft by 65ft] homes will be priced from RM616,000 and RM533,000 respectively.\n\n\n\n“We have another undeveloped parcel in Taman Pelangi Indah 2[ 81800 Ulu Tiram,\nJohor Bahru ]\n [of more than 900 acres]. We also have a 300-acre tract in Tanjung Kupang that has been earmarked for industrial development in the long term.”","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Sun, 10 Mar 2024 16:11:41 +0800"}

It will also help to expand the company’s footprint in the city centre,” said MB World executive director Cindi Sim.\n\nAnother major ongoing project by the company in the city centre is the MBW City development, comprising Veranda Residences, Trellis Residences and Avenue Residences with a combined GDV of RM2.2bil.\n\nVeranda Residences (phase one) with a total 649 units and an estimated GDV of RM308mil has been fully sold and is expected to obtain the certificate of completion and compliance by the end of this year.\n\nTrellis Residences offering 1,302 units with an estimated GDV of RM581mil is 90% sold.\n\nAvenue Residences has a total of 1,796 units and an estimated GDV of RM956mil. 51% of the non-bumiputra lots have been booked during its current soft launch period.\n\n The last phase of MBW City, the Veranda Residences (phase two) with a total 649 units and an estimated GDV of RM369mil, is expected to be launched in 2025.\n\n“We are excited with the performance of MBW City and would like to thank RHB Bank that shared the same vision with us and financed the project since we acquired the development land in 2019.\n\n“The bank has stepped up to finance our Pandan Heights project in Pandan City of Johor Baru.\n\n“The project offers 1,012 units and has an estimated GDV of RM490mil. To date, 56% of the non-bumiputra units have been sold since it opened for sale in August,” Sim added.\n\nMB World’s recent projects in Johor Baru also included Sierra Heights, Meldrum Heights, Aliff Heights and Idaman Heights totalling 2,525 units with a combined GDV of RM1.2bil.\n\n“Backed by the support and confidence of all end-financing banks, these projects have been well-received and achieved a high take-up rate.\n\n“This has also proven the potential of the Johor Baru property market, catalysed by the development of Johor Baru-Singapore Rapid Transit System or RTS link,” Sim explained.\n\n\n","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Mon, 11 Mar 2024 02:12:59 +0800"}

It is also in line with the group&#39;s wider strategy of continuing to acquire strategically located prime land in Johor Bahru, it said.\n\nThe company said site was near other matured developments such\n\n as Taman Mount Austin and Taman Daya \n\nand hence also offered several important advantages, in particular the sustained potential demand from upgraders in the area desiring to move-up to larger, newer and better designed houses.\n\n“Another source of demand is from young adults planning to move out of their parents&#39; homes without having to leave the comforts of the local support network that they have grown accustomed to.\n\n“Further, the existing population of the surrounding matured housing projects will also form the core catchment area for the proposed development&#39;s commercial components,” it said.\n\nS P Setia was confident that the proposed development of mixed residential and commercial project on the land would be well received, and contribute positively to its future earnings and cash flow.\n\n“The proposed development will also ensure S P Setia&#39;s continuing presence and efforts in building residential properties in Johor,” it said.\n\n\n\n\n\nS P Setia acquires land in Johor\nJanuary 28, 2011 \n\n\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: Top property developer S P Setia Bhd is purchasing a 265.7 acre piece of land in Johor Bahru for RM125.78 million, it told the local bourse on Friday, Jan 28.\n\nIts unit Setia Indah Sdn Bhd had on the same day entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement with Kenyalang Property Development Sdn Bhd for the acquisition, which will be developed into a mixed residential development project.\n\n&quot;The said land is situated in the Tebrau corridor, which is a fast growing area in Johor given increased development activities and new property launches as housing demand has spilled over from the congested Johor Bahru city to this corridor. The group&#39;s matured Setia Indah Johor township is located approximately 10 minutes from the land,&quot; it added.\n\nThe amount is calculated at the rate of RM11 psf based on a net land of 262.519 acres after excluding approximately 3.2 acres reserved for water pipeline.\n\nIn a separate media statement, its president and CEO Tan Sri Liew Kee Sin said the group is looking forward to taking advantage of the exciting happenings in the Iskandar Malaysia region to further broaden and deepen its already dominant position in the state, with about 1,500 acres of undeveloped landbank in Johor Bahru following this latest acquisition.\n\nThe developer believes that the robust Singapore economy will see a more sustainable rate of growth of 4% to 6% and create positive spill-over effects for Johor Bahru.\n\n&quot;The acquisition is in-line with the group&#39;s strategy to continue to grow and strengthen its presence in Johor Bahru. The land&#39;s location within the Tebrau corridor where the S P Setia has established a strong following enables it to tap further into the sustained potential demand from upgraders comprised within the group&#39;s own customer base and the surrounding matured residential areas,&quot; he added.\n\nS P Setia has been present in Johor for more than 13 years and has carved a solid reputation for delivering quality homes in its four ongoing projects, namely Bukit Indah Johor, Setia Indah Johor, Setia Tropika and Setia Eco Gardens.\n\nThe group&#39;s long presence and continuous efforts to create value for all its integrated townships in Johor have resulted in numerous local and international awards along with consistently strong sales.\n\n\n\n\n[UPDATE] S P Setia strengthens presence in Johor, to launch properties with a total GDV of &#036;182 mil this year\n\n4 June 2023\n\n\nAn artist’s impression of the entrance to Callista Green in Taman Rinting (Photo: S P Setia)\n\nSINGAPORE (EDGEPROP) - Johor’s real estate market appears to be on an upward trajectory, prompting developers to launch more projects this financial year, according to industry experts.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAttesting to the optimistic outlook, S P Setia Bhd plans to grow its presence in the southern region with a slew of launches worth a total gross development value (GDV) of RM618.76 million (&#036;182 million) in FY2023.\n\nThe property group has been making its mark in Johor with its diversified high-rises, townships, mixed-use developments and commercial centres since 1995. As at December 2022, the group had 8,489.16 acres of land bank in the state with a total GDV of about RM28.1 billion.\n\nIts well-known projects there include nine masterplan townships and developments in Bukit Indah in Taman Bukit Indah, Iskandar Puteri; Setia Eco Cascadia in Tebrau; Setia Eco Gardens in Gelang Patah; Setia Indah Johor; Setia Tropika; Setia Business Park I and Setia Business Park II; Taman Perling; Taman Rinting; Taman Pelangi; Taman Pelangi Indah I; Taman Industri Jaya; Mukim Tanjung Kupang in Iskandar Puteri; and Mukim Serkat in Pontian.\n\n“There has been a tremendous change [in the southern region’s land- scape] since we entered the Johor market with Bukit Indah,” recalls its divisional general manager Saniman Amat Yusof, who himself is a resident of Bukit Indah.\n\n\n\nSaniman: We are focused on rolling out our bread- and-butter products in the region, which are mainly landed residential properties (Photo: S P Setia) \n\n“Back then, especially in the early 2000s, things were very different, and values have since appreciated ... prices were roughly RM200,000 for landed homes back then but now, they are priced at RM700,000 [on average]. We didn’t have good internet connectivity, had limited accessibility [but are now connected to a network of highways, including the Eastern Dispersal Link (EDL), Lebuhraya Persisiran Pantai (Coastal Highway), PLUS Expressway and the Second Link Expressway]. It was not as vibrant as it is today in terms of retailers and facilities,” he tells The Edge Malaysia during a Microsoft Teams meeting.\n\n“I hardly leave the township for anything else because everything is easily available here. My family is quite pleased as well and my children’s schools are nearby. We would like our customers in Johor to experience the same level of convenience at all our townships, aligning with our tagline of ‘live, learn, work, play’.”\n\nIn 1995, S P Setia acquired 900 acres of land from UEM Land (now UEM Sunrise Bhd) and developed it into a planned housing estate. In 2000, the group bought another 300 acres of land for development purposes. Previously an oil palm estate, Bukit Indah has grown into a vibrant and green settlement spanning 1,521 acres with a total GDV of RM5.2 billion. The township is now home to about 60,000 people, who live in more than 10,000 houses.\n\n“This was our first project in Johor, even before Iskandar Malaysia was mooted. It proceeded to win the Johor State Landscape Award 2001, the National Landscape Competition 2001 and the Best National Landscape Award 2005. Bukit Indah is strategically located in Iskandar Malaysia and is only minutes away from Johor Baru,” says Saniman.\n\nThe property group plans to build on this momentum and establish more developments in their masterplans in the southern region over the short and long term.\n\nSaniman says S P Setia’s plans to roll out a few projects in FY2023, namely Adonis at Taman Rinting; Hazelton and Clymer at Setia Eco Cascadia; Palmwood at Taman Pelangi Indah; and Maple &amp; Pine (Phase 2) at Setia Eco Gardens.\n\n\n\nAn artist’s impression of Adonis in Taman Rinting (Photo: S P Setia)\n\n\nAppearing sanguine about the upcoming launches in the southern region, Saniman elaborates on the group’s overall plans. “We are focused on rolling out our bread-and-butter products in the region, which are mainly landed residential properties [priced from RM600,000], and we are confident they will perform well.\n\n\n The key is to price the products well, even though we are mindful of the rising construction costs [which remains a challenge] and other market factors.”\n\nHe adds that a way to overcome this is by simplifying the design of the units. “We have been injecting more eco-themed, sustainable elements and smart home features, and even allocated spaces for solar panels, rather than adding more elements that are costly. There are alternative smart ways to enhance a home while minimising the overall cost and maintenance.\n\n“So far this year, we have launched cluster homes, Calliandra in Setia Tropika; \n\n\nwe also plan to launch Longevia at the same township next month. \n\nThe response has been really good as they are fully booked. We have also launched super link terraced units in Taman Pelangi Indah, which are also fully booked, followed by Clymer and Hazelton (Phase 2) in February and more units in Taman Rinting.”(  81750 Masai Johor)\n\n\nSaniman also mentions details of upcoming launches, particularly Adonis, which is sprawled on an 831-acre parcel in Taman Rinting and comprises two-storey terraced houses and semi-detached homes.\n\n“We are launching 60 units of Desiran 2 (20ft by 70ft) at Adonis, which have a total GDV of RM43 million, in October. The units will be priced from RM720,000,” he says.\n\n“We will launch 2-storey terraced homes Clymer and Hazelton (specifically subphase Alluvia Phase 3 and Phase 4) in Setia Eco Cascadia, which will account for a total GDV of RM147 million, in 1Q2024. The units will be 20ft by 70ft and 22ft by 70ft, and priced from RM754,800.”\n\nIn September, S P Setia will unveil Palmwood — specifically Palmwood 2 (51 units) — in Taman Pelangi Indah that will have a total GDV of RM45 million. The 28ft by 65ft units will be priced from RM845,200.\n\n“We will also launch Maple and Pine (Phase 2) in Setia Eco Gardens. They will comprise 124 units on 765 acres of land and have a total GDVof RM69 million. Maple 2 [20ft by 65ft] and Pine 2 [18ft by 65ft] homes will be priced from RM616,000 and RM533,000 respectively.\n\n\n\n“We have another undeveloped parcel in Taman Pelangi Indah 2[ 81800 Ulu Tiram,\nJohor Bahru ]\n [of more than 900 acres].

{"title":"Adidas no more gooding? post 1st loss in 30yr, ","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5445213","description":"HERZOGENAURACH, Germany, March 13 (Reuters) - German sportswear giant Adidas (ADSGn.DE) posted its first annual loss in more than 30 years on Wednesday and warned sales in North America would fall again as sportswear retailers in the U.S. struggle with high inventories.\nAdidas has been battling to right itself after it cut ties with Kanye West in October 2022, suspending sales of the highly profitable Yeezy sneaker line.\n\nIn CEO Bjorn Gulden&#39;s first year in the role, he resumed sales of Yeezy sneakers to clear remaining stock while seeking to boost popular products like Samba and Gazelle shoes, and improve relationships with retailers. Shares in Adidas have staged a recovery, outperforming Nike and Puma since he took over.\n\n&quot;Although by far not good enough, 2023 ended better than what I had expected at the beginning of the year,&quot; Gulden said.\n\nAdidas shares were trading flat as of 1115 GMT.\n\nThis year North America will continue to be weak with Adidas expecting sales to fall by around 5% this year.\n\nLower demand and overstocked stores in the U.S. have weighed on sportswear and apparel companies, and Adidas said sales in North America fell by 21% in the fourth quarter and by 16% over the year.\n\nOverall, Gulden said clearing stock through its outlet stores helped Adidas bring inventories down by 1.5 billion euros in 2023, a 24% decline.\n\nAdidas has flagged shipment delays of two to three weeks due to the Red Sea crisis, and Chief Financial Officer Harm Ohlmeyer said on Wednesday that there could be an impact on working capital if the disruptions continue.\n\n&#39;RIGHT DIRECTION&#39;\n\nAdidas terminates its partnership with American rapper and designer Kanye West\nAdidas merchandise is seen in an Adidas store on the day the German company terminated its partnership with the American rapper and designer Kanye West, now known as Ye, in Garden City, New... Purchase Licensing Rights Read more\nAdidas is gambling that it can claw back market share from rivals even as consumers&#39; overall appetite for sportswear declines, sparking job cuts at Nike.\n\nAdidas expects its underlying business - excluding Yeezy - to improve in 2024, with growth of at least 10% in the second half.\n\nIt has benefited from a trend for low-rise suede &quot;terrace&quot; sneakers like the Samba and Gazelle, and last year ramped up production. That trend helped footwear sales grow by 8% in the fourth quarter, while apparel sales fell 13%.\n&quot;Things have clearly been going in the right direction at Adidas since Bjorn Gulden took over,&quot; said Thomas Joekel, portfolio manager at Union Investment. &quot;Brand heat is increasing, which can also be seen from the fact that fewer products now have to be sold at a discount.&quot;\n\nIn China Adidas expects a stronger recovery, with sales growing at a double-digit rate after an 8% increase in 2023.\n\nAdidas last month set expectations low for its remaining Yeezy products, saying it would sell the sneakers &quot;at least at cost&quot;. It launched its latest drop on Feb. 26, but demand for the shoes is difficult to predict.\n\nThe Yeezy sales are &quot;still a little bit of a wild card,&quot; said Cristina Fernandez, analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, despite the company managing the sales successfully so far.\n\nAdidas made 750 million euros in revenue from Yeezy sales last year, resulting in a 300 million euro profit. The company set aside 140 million euros for donations to charities fighting antisemitism and racism.\n\nAdidas&#39; board will propose an unchanged dividend of 0.70 euros (&#036;0.7650) per share on its 2023 performance despite a net loss of 58 million euros, its first since 1992.\n\n(&#036;1 = 0.9151 euros)","author":"premier239","pubDate":"Thu, 14 Mar 2024 16:52:13 +0800"}

It will also help to expand the company’s footprint in the city centre,” said MB World executive director Cindi Sim.\n\nAnother major ongoing project by the company in the city centre is the MBW City development, comprising Veranda Residences, Trellis Residences and Avenue Residences with a combined GDV of RM2.2bil.\n\nVeranda Residences (phase one) with a total 649 units and an estimated GDV of RM308mil has been fully sold and is expected to obtain the certificate of completion and compliance by the end of this year.\n\nTrellis Residences offering 1,302 units with an estimated GDV of RM581mil is 90% sold.\n\nAvenue Residences has a total of 1,796 units and an estimated GDV of RM956mil. 51% of the non-bumiputra lots have been booked during its current soft launch period.\n\n The last phase of MBW City, the Veranda Residences (phase two) with a total 649 units and an estimated GDV of RM369mil, is expected to be launched in 2025.\n\n“We are excited with the performance of MBW City and would like to thank RHB Bank that shared the same vision with us and financed the project since we acquired the development land in 2019.\n\n“The bank has stepped up to finance our Pandan Heights project in Pandan City of Johor Baru.\n\n“The project offers 1,012 units and has an estimated GDV of RM490mil.

{"title":"Sunway Coachrane, ","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5446358","description":"Sunway City Kuala Lumpur, 19th April, 2021 ~ Sunway Berhad’s (Sunway) wholly-owned subsidiary, Sunway Rahman Putra Sdn Bhd, has today signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement to acquire a 6.59-acre parcel of prime freehold land at Jalan Cochrane, Kuala Lumpur from Mutiara Rini Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Boustead Properties Berhad, for a purchase consideration of RM233.4 million.\nThe land is strategically located for a transit-oriented mixed development comprising serviced apartments with a retail podium and is located directly opposite the Cochrane MRT station and just a stone’s throw away from MyTOWN Shopping Centre. The station is part of the Sungai Buloh-Kajang Line and brings commuters directly to the heart of Kuala Lumpur and other major suburbs like Cheras and Damansara.\nMost significantly, the station is just one stop away from the Tun Razak Exchange (“TRX”), the future International Financial District of Kuala Lumpur, which has now reached its inflection point, with the recent completions of Exchange 106, Menara Prudential and HSBC TRX. TRX is expected to house more than 45,000 employees in the near future.\nCommenting on the acquisition, Sunway Property’s Managing Director, Sarena Cheah said, “We are extremely excited with this acquisition as it will strengthen our presence in this vicinity where we have already developed and invested substantially in the very successful Sunway Velocity and Sunway Velocity TWO, both of which are MSC Cybercentre status developments. We believe the future is even more exciting with the upcoming completions in TRX, which will bring in a substantial population of high income, professional workers. We can imagine them wanting to stay at our proposed development here which is just one station away from TRX, with all the amenities at its doorstep and at a much better value.”\nLocated at the fringe of the Golden Triangle, Cochrane has gentrified substantially over the years with Sunway playing a key role in the process. Sunway Velocity, with a GDV of over RM4.0 billion, is just 200 meters away from the site and is a highly successful integrated development with over 23 acres of freehold land. The development encompasses Sunway Velocity Mall, a 1-million square feet net lettable area shopping mall, Sunway Velocity Hotel, a 350-room hotel, Sunway Medical Centre Velocity, a 240-bed medical centre, Sunway College @ Velocity, two office towers with a total floor area of 375,000 square feet and residential units. The developer’s latest development, Sunway Velocity TWO, with a GDV of RM2 billion, is located on another 8.5-acre site right opposite Sunway Velocity and is linked to 3 MRT and 2 LRT stations.\nThe vendor, Boustead Group, has also developed significant landmarks in the vicinity, with MyTOWN Shopping Centre located just diagonally across this site and One Cochrane Residences further up the road. With the upcoming completion of The Exchange TRX Mall, residents at the proposed development on this site will be spoilt for choice when it comes to retail options.\nParents with school-going children will undoubtedly appreciate the selection of reputable schools that this neighbourhood has to offer, such as Tsun Jin Primary School, Taylor’s International School and Sunway College @ Velocity, all within a 1-km radius.\nConnectivity of the site via major roads is also enviable with Jalan Cochrane feeding traffic to major highways such as the Maju Expressway (MEX), the SMART tunnel and the Sungai Besi Expressway.\nTouching on the proposed development on the site, Sarena said, “The proposed gross development value will be at least RM1.15 billion. The development will comprise serviced apartments that sit on top of a retail podium, which will benefit from road frontages on all four sides of the site.”\nThis acquisition is Master Community Developer, Sunway Property’s, second landbank acquisition for the year and reflects its confidence in the recovery of the property market in the coming years.\nCheah adds, “The property market in Malaysia has experienced several challenging years but we have faith that with economic recovery post-Covid, the demand will return, especially in a strong location such as Cochrane where there is a convergence of convenience and affordability – a combination that has become scarce in strong city locations. This exciting mixed-development will be highly desirable amongst our multiple customer segments.”\nCurrently, Sunway’s total landbank stands at 3,339 acres with a potential gross development value of RM52.1 billion over a total development period of more than 15 years, paving the way for resilient growth.\n\nCite from Sunway Property News \n\n<a href='https://pictr.com/image/Etnx0I' target='_blank'><img src='https://pictr.com/images/2024/03/19/Etnx0I.md.jpg' border='0' alt='user posted image' /></a>","author":"bennomin","pubDate":"Tue, 19 Mar 2024 23:11:43 +0800"}

It is also in line with the group&#39;s wider strategy of continuing to acquire strategically located prime land in Johor Bahru, it said.\n\nThe company said site was near other matured developments such\n\n as Taman Mount Austin and Taman Daya \n\nand hence also offered several important advantages, in particular the sustained potential demand from upgraders in the area desiring to move-up to larger, newer and better designed houses.\n\n“Another source of demand is from young adults planning to move out of their parents&#39; homes without having to leave the comforts of the local support network that they have grown accustomed to.\n\n“Further, the existing population of the surrounding matured housing projects will also form the core catchment area for the proposed development&#39;s commercial components,” it said.\n\nS P Setia was confident that the proposed development of mixed residential and commercial project on the land would be well received, and contribute positively to its future earnings and cash flow.\n\n“The proposed development will also ensure S P Setia&#39;s continuing presence and efforts in building residential properties in Johor,” it said.\n\n\n\n\n\nS P Setia acquires land in Johor\nJanuary 28, 2011 \n\n\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: Top property developer S P Setia Bhd is purchasing a 265.7 acre piece of land in Johor Bahru for RM125.78 million, it told the local bourse on Friday, Jan 28.\n\nIts unit Setia Indah Sdn Bhd had on the same day entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement with Kenyalang Property Development Sdn Bhd for the acquisition, which will be developed into a mixed residential development project.\n\n&quot;The said land is situated in the Tebrau corridor, which is a fast growing area in Johor given increased development activities and new property launches as housing demand has spilled over from the congested Johor Bahru city to this corridor. The group&#39;s matured Setia Indah Johor township is located approximately 10 minutes from the land,&quot; it added.\n\nThe amount is calculated at the rate of RM11 psf based on a net land of 262.519 acres after excluding approximately 3.2 acres reserved for water pipeline.\n\nIn a separate media statement, its president and CEO Tan Sri Liew Kee Sin said the group is looking forward to taking advantage of the exciting happenings in the Iskandar Malaysia region to further broaden and deepen its already dominant position in the state, with about 1,500 acres of undeveloped landbank in Johor Bahru following this latest acquisition.\n\nThe developer believes that the robust Singapore economy will see a more sustainable rate of growth of 4% to 6% and create positive spill-over effects for Johor Bahru.\n\n&quot;The acquisition is in-line with the group&#39;s strategy to continue to grow and strengthen its presence in Johor Bahru. The land&#39;s location within the Tebrau corridor where the S P Setia has established a strong following enables it to tap further into the sustained potential demand from upgraders comprised within the group&#39;s own customer base and the surrounding matured residential areas,&quot; he added.\n\nS P Setia has been present in Johor for more than 13 years and has carved a solid reputation for delivering quality homes in its four ongoing projects, namely Bukit Indah Johor, Setia Indah Johor, Setia Tropika and Setia Eco Gardens.\n\nThe group&#39;s long presence and continuous efforts to create value for all its integrated townships in Johor have resulted in numerous local and international awards along with consistently strong sales.\n\n\n\n\n[UPDATE] S P Setia strengthens presence in Johor, to launch properties with a total GDV of &#036;182 mil this year\n\n4 June 2023\n\n\nAn artist’s impression of the entrance to Callista Green in Taman Rinting (Photo: S P Setia)\n\nSINGAPORE (EDGEPROP) - Johor’s real estate market appears to be on an upward trajectory, prompting developers to launch more projects this financial year, according to industry experts.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAttesting to the optimistic outlook, S P Setia Bhd plans to grow its presence in the southern region with a slew of launches worth a total gross development value (GDV) of RM618.76 million (&#036;182 million) in FY2023.\n\nThe property group has been making its mark in Johor with its diversified high-rises, townships, mixed-use developments and commercial centres since 1995. As at December 2022, the group had 8,489.16 acres of land bank in the state with a total GDV of about RM28.1 billion.\n\nIts well-known projects there include nine masterplan townships and developments in Bukit Indah in Taman Bukit Indah, Iskandar Puteri; Setia Eco Cascadia in Tebrau; Setia Eco Gardens in Gelang Patah; Setia Indah Johor; Setia Tropika; Setia Business Park I and Setia Business Park II; Taman Perling; Taman Rinting; Taman Pelangi; Taman Pelangi Indah I; Taman Industri Jaya; Mukim Tanjung Kupang in Iskandar Puteri; and Mukim Serkat in Pontian.\n\n“There has been a tremendous change [in the southern region’s land- scape] since we entered the Johor market with Bukit Indah,” recalls its divisional general manager Saniman Amat Yusof, who himself is a resident of Bukit Indah.\n\n\n\nSaniman: We are focused on rolling out our bread- and-butter products in the region, which are mainly landed residential properties (Photo: S P Setia) \n\n“Back then, especially in the early 2000s, things were very different, and values have since appreciated ... prices were roughly RM200,000 for landed homes back then but now, they are priced at RM700,000 [on average]. We didn’t have good internet connectivity, had limited accessibility [but are now connected to a network of highways, including the Eastern Dispersal Link (EDL), Lebuhraya Persisiran Pantai (Coastal Highway), PLUS Expressway and the Second Link Expressway]. It was not as vibrant as it is today in terms of retailers and facilities,” he tells The Edge Malaysia during a Microsoft Teams meeting.\n\n“I hardly leave the township for anything else because everything is easily available here. My family is quite pleased as well and my children’s schools are nearby. We would like our customers in Johor to experience the same level of convenience at all our townships, aligning with our tagline of ‘live, learn, work, play’.”\n\nIn 1995, S P Setia acquired 900 acres of land from UEM Land (now UEM Sunrise Bhd) and developed it into a planned housing estate. In 2000, the group bought another 300 acres of land for development purposes. Previously an oil palm estate, Bukit Indah has grown into a vibrant and green settlement spanning 1,521 acres with a total GDV of RM5.2 billion. The township is now home to about 60,000 people, who live in more than 10,000 houses.\n\n“This was our first project in Johor, even before Iskandar Malaysia was mooted. It proceeded to win the Johor State Landscape Award 2001, the National Landscape Competition 2001 and the Best National Landscape Award 2005. Bukit Indah is strategically located in Iskandar Malaysia and is only minutes away from Johor Baru,” says Saniman.\n\nThe property group plans to build on this momentum and establish more developments in their masterplans in the southern region over the short and long term.\n\nSaniman says S P Setia’s plans to roll out a few projects in FY2023, namely Adonis at Taman Rinting; Hazelton and Clymer at Setia Eco Cascadia; Palmwood at Taman Pelangi Indah; and Maple &amp; Pine (Phase 2) at Setia Eco Gardens.\n\n\n\nAn artist’s impression of Adonis in Taman Rinting (Photo: S P Setia)\n\n\nAppearing sanguine about the upcoming launches in the southern region, Saniman elaborates on the group’s overall plans. “We are focused on rolling out our bread-and-butter products in the region, which are mainly landed residential properties [priced from RM600,000], and we are confident they will perform well.\n\n\n The key is to price the products well, even though we are mindful of the rising construction costs [which remains a challenge] and other market factors.”\n\nHe adds that a way to overcome this is by simplifying the design of the units. “We have been injecting more eco-themed, sustainable elements and smart home features, and even allocated spaces for solar panels, rather than adding more elements that are costly. There are alternative smart ways to enhance a home while minimising the overall cost and maintenance.\n\n“So far this year, we have launched cluster homes, Calliandra in Setia Tropika; \n\n\nwe also plan to launch Longevia at the same township next month. \n\nThe response has been really good as they are fully booked. We have also launched super link terraced units in Taman Pelangi Indah, which are also fully booked, followed by Clymer and Hazelton (Phase 2) in February and more units in Taman Rinting.”(  81750 Masai Johor)\n\n\nSaniman also mentions details of upcoming launches, particularly Adonis, which is sprawled on an 831-acre parcel in Taman Rinting and comprises two-storey terraced houses and semi-detached homes.\n\n“We are launching 60 units of Desiran 2 (20ft by 70ft) at Adonis, which have a total GDV of RM43 million, in October. The units will be priced from RM720,000,” he says.\n\n“We will launch 2-storey terraced homes Clymer and Hazelton (specifically subphase Alluvia Phase 3 and Phase 4) in Setia Eco Cascadia, which will account for a total GDV of RM147 million, in 1Q2024. The units will be 20ft by 70ft and 22ft by 70ft, and priced from RM754,800.”\n\nIn September, S P Setia will unveil Palmwood — specifically Palmwood 2 (51 units) — in Taman Pelangi Indah that will have a total GDV of RM45 million. The 28ft by 65ft units will be priced from RM845,200.\n\n“We will also launch Maple and Pine (Phase 2) in Setia Eco Gardens. They will comprise 124 units on 765 acres of land and have a total GDVof RM69 million. Maple 2 [20ft by 65ft] and Pine 2 [18ft by 65ft] homes will be priced from RM616,000 and RM533,000 respectively.\n\n\n\n“We have another undeveloped parcel in Taman Pelangi Indah 2[ 81800 Ulu Tiram,\nJohor Bahru ]\n [of more than 900 acres]. We also have a 300-acre tract in Tanjung Kupang that has been earmarked for industrial development in the long term.”","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Sun, 10 Mar 2024 16:11:41 +0800"}

{"title":"Sunway Coachrane, ","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5446358","description":"Sunway City Kuala Lumpur, 19th April, 2021 ~ Sunway Berhad’s (Sunway) wholly-owned subsidiary, Sunway Rahman Putra Sdn Bhd, has today signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement to acquire a 6.59-acre parcel of prime freehold land at Jalan Cochrane, Kuala Lumpur from Mutiara Rini Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Boustead Properties Berhad, for a purchase consideration of RM233.4 million.\nThe land is strategically located for a transit-oriented mixed development comprising serviced apartments with a retail podium and is located directly opposite the Cochrane MRT station and just a stone’s throw away from MyTOWN Shopping Centre. The station is part of the Sungai Buloh-Kajang Line and brings commuters directly to the heart of Kuala Lumpur and other major suburbs like Cheras and Damansara.\nMost significantly, the station is just one stop away from the Tun Razak Exchange (“TRX”), the future International Financial District of Kuala Lumpur, which has now reached its inflection point, with the recent completions of Exchange 106, Menara Prudential and HSBC TRX. TRX is expected to house more than 45,000 employees in the near future.\nCommenting on the acquisition, Sunway Property’s Managing Director, Sarena Cheah said, “We are extremely excited with this acquisition as it will strengthen our presence in this vicinity where we have already developed and invested substantially in the very successful Sunway Velocity and Sunway Velocity TWO, both of which are MSC Cybercentre status developments. We believe the future is even more exciting with the upcoming completions in TRX, which will bring in a substantial population of high income, professional workers. We can imagine them wanting to stay at our proposed development here which is just one station away from TRX, with all the amenities at its doorstep and at a much better value.”\nLocated at the fringe of the Golden Triangle, Cochrane has gentrified substantially over the years with Sunway playing a key role in the process. Sunway Velocity, with a GDV of over RM4.0 billion, is just 200 meters away from the site and is a highly successful integrated development with over 23 acres of freehold land. The development encompasses Sunway Velocity Mall, a 1-million square feet net lettable area shopping mall, Sunway Velocity Hotel, a 350-room hotel, Sunway Medical Centre Velocity, a 240-bed medical centre, Sunway College @ Velocity, two office towers with a total floor area of 375,000 square feet and residential units. The developer’s latest development, Sunway Velocity TWO, with a GDV of RM2 billion, is located on another 8.5-acre site right opposite Sunway Velocity and is linked to 3 MRT and 2 LRT stations.\nThe vendor, Boustead Group, has also developed significant landmarks in the vicinity, with MyTOWN Shopping Centre located just diagonally across this site and One Cochrane Residences further up the road. With the upcoming completion of The Exchange TRX Mall, residents at the proposed development on this site will be spoilt for choice when it comes to retail options.\nParents with school-going children will undoubtedly appreciate the selection of reputable schools that this neighbourhood has to offer, such as Tsun Jin Primary School, Taylor’s International School and Sunway College @ Velocity, all within a 1-km radius.\nConnectivity of the site via major roads is also enviable with Jalan Cochrane feeding traffic to major highways such as the Maju Expressway (MEX), the SMART tunnel and the Sungai Besi Expressway.\nTouching on the proposed development on the site, Sarena said, “The proposed gross development value will be at least RM1.15 billion. The development will comprise serviced apartments that sit on top of a retail podium, which will benefit from road frontages on all four sides of the site.”\nThis acquisition is Master Community Developer, Sunway Property’s, second landbank acquisition for the year and reflects its confidence in the recovery of the property market in the coming years.\nCheah adds, “The property market in Malaysia has experienced several challenging years but we have faith that with economic recovery post-Covid, the demand will return, especially in a strong location such as Cochrane where there is a convergence of convenience and affordability – a combination that has become scarce in strong city locations. This exciting mixed-development will be highly desirable amongst our multiple customer segments.”\nCurrently, Sunway’s total landbank stands at 3,339 acres with a potential gross development value of RM52.1 billion over a total development period of more than 15 years, paving the way for resilient growth.\n\nCite from Sunway Property News \n\n<a href='https://pictr.com/image/Etnx0I' target='_blank'><img src='https://pictr.com/images/2024/03/19/Etnx0I.md.jpg' border='0' alt='user posted image' /></a>","author":"bennomin","pubDate":"Tue, 19 Mar 2024 23:11:43 +0800"}

I believe Setia Eco Cascadia also has not much empty land left.\n\nAccording to a report from Kuala Lumpur dated January 5th, 2024, Scientex Berhad&#39;s second attempt to purchase prime land in Johor Bahru from SP Setia Berhad, this time for RM548 million, has fallen through again. Scientex first attempted to acquire the Johor land in 2021 for RM518.1 million. However, the deal fell through in March 2023 after it failed to obtain a waiver of\n\nthe Bumiputera equity condition imposed by the Economic Planning Unit (EPU). In July 2023, both parties revisited the deal, with a new price tag of RM547.65 million.\n\nOn Friday, Scientex and SP Setia stated in Bursa filings that the deal to purchase the freehold 960-acre land in Tebrau was terminated due to non-fulfillment of the conditions precedent within the extended completion period.\n\n\nAccording to SP Setia, the disposal was terminated as Scientex&#39;s unit, Scientex Lestari Sdn Bhd, was unable to obtain EPU approval for the acquisition. Scientex mentioned that SP Setia will refund the deposit paid, along with the accrued interest, as per the terms of the sale and purchase agreement (SPA).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCould Kulai, Kangkar Pulai, Masai or Ulu Tiram become the next successful townships on the outskirts of Johor Bahru since most of the land in JB has been utilized from 2020 to 2024?","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Mon, 08 Apr 2024 20:12:01 +0800"}

It is also surrounded by colourful gardens, lush greenery and pristine lakes.\n\nThe township is near Spring Labs, a retail concept park that has picturesque spots, cafés and restaurants that are aesthetically pleasing.\n\nAnother commercial hotspot within the vicinity is Eco Palladium, a hub that will be filled with F&amp;B outlets, retail shops and services, education institutions and wellness centres.\n\n\nEco Summer is a 200-acre garden-concept residential development situated in Tebrau, Johor, launched at the same time as its 400-acre fraternal twin township Eco Spring and projected to be completed around the same time too, in May 2017. \n\n\nOnce entering the gated and guarded borders of the development, Eco Summer’s 50-foot-wide roads lead past vistas of colourful, summery flowers and vibrant greenery.\n\n\n Residents will also enjoy facilities like a basketball court, playground, function lawn and an outdoor fitness deck with gymnasium. \n\nThe Eco Summer development is divided into two halves – the North Garden and South Garden. \n\nBoth portions offer double-storey link houses in the style of English colonial bungalows and townhouses\n\n\n\nSetia Eco Garden,\nTaman Nusa Sentral,\nHorizon Hills,\nEco Botanic,\nEco Summer,\nEco Spring,\nAdda heights,\n\n\n were built between 2000 and 2024.\n\nMany shop lots, gated and guarded condo, double-storey clusters and terrace houses, and semi-detached and three-storey or two-storey bungalows have been selling like hotcakes.\n\n\n \n\n\nWhy SP Setia Berhad is now only focusing on Taman Rinting, Masai and Setia Eco Gardens in the Johor Bahru area?\n\n\nLeft is only one new Taman Perling condo not yet launched.\n\n\nDo they still have land in Taman Perling?\n\nIs it because the Johor Bahru market is currently not favorable, so they want to sell their land in Tebrau to Scientex Bhd?\n\nNow, Setia Tropika and Bukit Indah have only a few percent of undeveloped land left. I believe Setia Eco Cascadia also has not much empty land left.\n\nAccording to a report from Kuala Lumpur dated January 5th, 2024, Scientex Berhad&#39;s second attempt to purchase prime land in Johor Bahru from SP Setia Berhad, this time for RM548 million, has fallen through again. Scientex first attempted to acquire the Johor land in 2021 for RM518.1 million. However, the deal fell through in March 2023 after it failed to obtain a waiver of\n\nthe Bumiputera equity condition imposed by the Economic Planning Unit (EPU). In July 2023, both parties revisited the deal, with a new price tag of RM547.65 million.\n\nOn Friday, Scientex and SP Setia stated in Bursa filings that the deal to purchase the freehold 960-acre land in Tebrau was terminated due to non-fulfillment of the conditions precedent within the extended completion period.\n\n\nAccording to SP Setia, the disposal was terminated as Scientex&#39;s unit, Scientex Lestari Sdn Bhd, was unable to obtain EPU approval for the acquisition. Scientex mentioned that SP Setia will refund the deposit paid, along with the accrued interest, as per the terms of the sale and purchase agreement (SPA).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCould Kulai, Kangkar Pulai, Masai or Ulu Tiram become the next successful townships on the outskirts of Johor Bahru since most of the land in JB has been utilized from 2020 to 2024?","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Mon, 08 Apr 2024 20:12:01 +0800"}

It is also surrounded by colourful gardens, lush greenery and pristine lakes.\n\nThe township is near Spring Labs, a retail concept park that has picturesque spots, cafés and restaurants that are aesthetically pleasing.\n\nAnother commercial hotspot within the vicinity is Eco Palladium, a hub that will be filled with F&amp;B outlets, retail shops and services, education institutions and wellness centres.\n\n\nEco Summer is a 200-acre garden-concept residential development situated in Tebrau, Johor, launched at the same time as its 400-acre fraternal twin township Eco Spring and projected to be completed around the same time too, in May 2017. \n\n\nOnce entering the gated and guarded borders of the development, Eco Summer’s 50-foot-wide roads lead past vistas of colourful, summery flowers and vibrant greenery.\n\n\n Residents will also enjoy facilities like a basketball court, playground, function lawn and an outdoor fitness deck with gymnasium. \n\nThe Eco Summer development is divided into two halves – the North Garden and South Garden. \n\nBoth portions offer double-storey link houses in the style of English colonial bungalows and townhouses\n\n\n\nSetia Eco Garden,\nTaman Nusa Sentral,\nHorizon Hills,\nEco Botanic,\nEco Summer,\nEco Spring,\nAdda heights,\n\n\n were built between 2000 and 2024.\n\nMany shop lots, gated and guarded condo, double-storey clusters and terrace houses, and semi-detached and three-storey or two-storey bungalows have been selling like hotcakes.\n\n\n \n\n\nWhy SP Setia Berhad is now only focusing on Taman Rinting, Masai and Setia Eco Gardens in the Johor Bahru area?\n\n\nLeft is only one new Taman Perling condo not yet launched.\n\n\nDo they still have land in Taman Perling?\n\nIs it because the Johor Bahru market is currently not favorable, so they want to sell their land in Tebrau to Scientex Bhd?\n\nNow, Setia Tropika and Bukit Indah have only a few percent of undeveloped land left. I believe Setia Eco Cascadia also has not much empty land left.\n\nAccording to a report from Kuala Lumpur dated January 5th, 2024, Scientex Berhad&#39;s second attempt to purchase prime land in Johor Bahru from SP Setia Berhad, this time for RM548 million, has fallen through again. Scientex first attempted to acquire the Johor land in 2021 for RM518.1 million. However, the deal fell through in March 2023 after it failed to obtain a waiver of\n\nthe Bumiputera equity condition imposed by the Economic Planning Unit (EPU). In July 2023, both parties revisited the deal, with a new price tag of RM547.65 million.\n\nOn Friday, Scientex and SP Setia stated in Bursa filings that the deal to purchase the freehold 960-acre land in Tebrau was terminated due to non-fulfillment of the conditions precedent within the extended completion period.\n\n\nAccording to SP Setia, the disposal was terminated as Scientex&#39;s unit, Scientex Lestari Sdn Bhd, was unable to obtain EPU approval for the acquisition. Scientex mentioned that SP Setia will refund the deposit paid, along with the accrued interest, as per the terms of the sale and purchase agreement (SPA).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCould Kulai, Kangkar Pulai, Masai or Ulu Tiram become the next successful townships on the outskirts of Johor Bahru since most of the land in JB has been utilized from 2020 to 2024?","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Mon, 08 Apr 2024 20:12:01 +0800"}

However the current owner stated that he and his family will only move out in Mid January 2025, pending the completion of his new place. The agent had said we could sign the S&amp;P stating when the property will be handed over to me, and all I need to do is pay 10% and bank will only disburse on the mentioned date. \nIs there a downside of doing this, what precautions should I take or should I avoid this altogether?

A friend is trying to rent a place in JB and surprisingly enough, all the property agents are asking for agent fees. I do understand there would be fees borne by the owner who is requesting the services of the agent to find a tenant for their place. Usually a month of rent for a year lease, etc.\nBut never have I heard to a tenant who is finding a place themself via propertyguru, etc. The fee is somewhat like 3/4 of the 1st month rental. \n\nJust curious to know from other owners, tenants or agents here. \n\nThanks.","author":"tesh94","pubDate":"Wed, 08 May 2024 01:23:21 +0800"}
