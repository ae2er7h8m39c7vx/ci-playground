Also considering other factors such as Landed Property expansions, Covid Recovery, RTS etc<br />I&#39;m not familiar with real estate market so I&#39;m genuinely asking what would the future trend of prices. I would like to use this info to decide to buy the subsale unit for own stay and possibly renting it out in the future if I ever decide to move back to KL. I&#39;m not desperate to buy a house as I&#39;ve already owned one and fully paid in KL. But if the monthly installment+maintenance is going to be at least equal to or less than the rental then I see why not to buy one. More so, the units look well-renovated and fully furnished.</i><br /><br /><b>CONTEXT<br /></b><br />I&#39;ve relocated from KL to Setia Tropika about 1.5 years ago and been renting here since in one of the apartments called Sky Garden Residence ( another neighbouring apartment Sky Peak Residence)<br />I love this place, a lot of shops within walking distance, right at PLUS exit, and within a 15-20mins drive to all major towns in Johor Metro (Kulai, Senai, Skudai, Dato Onn, Austin, Tebrau, Southkey, JB)<br />Also relaxing 15-30mins drive to/from work in Senai.<br /><br />2022 - I rented a 3+1, 1200 sqft unit, fully furnished, 2 car park unit for rm1300. for rental renewal, my landlord increased the rental to rm1700, He told me he had to because his instalment is very high (not my problem, lol). So I moved out to another unit in the same apartment.<br />2023 - 2+1, 1000 sqft, FF, 1 car park  - rm1500.<br />2024 - looking at the rental rate for the similar unit I have now, it seems like nothing less than rm1800, so I kind of have these feeling my current landlord will up the rental rate.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been looking at the sub-sale prices and it seems to be going down since 2022. My first rented unit was going for RM480K, even when I moved out my landlord offered me a similar rate and then went down to RM450K when I ignored the 1st offer. And this was in April 2023.<br />Currently, I&#39;ve been seeing these units going for RM420K. 2+1 units (similar to the one I&#39;m renting now) are going for RM380K. Neighbouring apartment Sky Peak seeing a similar trend, though it&#39;s slightly more expensive than Sky Garden.<br /><br /><b>Rental rates are going up but subsale prices are going down? Why?</b>[I]<br /><br />Now, I just saw that SP Setia going to build another apartment right between Sky Garden and Sky Peak. I checked with them, the max price will be RM550K for 3-bedroom units 850sqft.<br />There is another apartment across the PLUS highway called D&#39;Secret Garden 2 by KSL that is under construction, right next to 6-year-old D&#39;Secret Garden 1.","author":"Kakistok","pubDate":"Sun, 10 Dec 2023 15:07:37 +0800"}

Apparently, this husband (second husband) has history of abusing the wife, and this is the first time the wife reporting on her husband.<br /><br />Thank god the access card and keys are with the wife. Tenancy agreement is signed under the husband&#39;s name and the agreement is with the wife as well. She wants to change the agreement to her name. I have the rental and utilities deposit, but the deposit is transferred to me via the husband&#39;s account.

Business costs, political stability, and pro-business policies are the factors to take into account,&quot; he told NST Property.\n\n  Tan said that Mah Sing may be able to generate positive sales from its proposed development, given that the land is in an excellent location close to Lima Kedai, where there is a decent mix of low- to high-income groups.\n\n\n  Lima Kedai is a crucial transit hub for those using the Second Link Motorway.\n\n  According to Tan, there are numerous employment hubs in and near Pulai, including Southern Industrial Logistics and Clusters (SiLC), Nusajaya Tech Park, Tanjung Bin, and the Port of Tanjung Pelepas, which are increasing demand for houses.\n\n\n  Mah Sing paid RM 76.09 million, or RM23 per square foot (psf), for 30.63 hectares   (  75.68 acres)    in Pulai to expand its M-series.\n\n  It plans to introduce M Tiara, a community of \n\ndouble-storey cluster homes (32&#39;x70&#39;/75&#39;) and\n\n2240 sq ft\n\n\n double-storey terraced homes (20&#39;/22&#39;x70&#39;), \n\n\n1400 sq ft\n\n\nwith a gross development value (GDV) of RM480 million.\n\n\n\n\n  According to Mah Sing&#39;s statement yesterday, the most affordable residential units are anticipated to cost RM624,800.\n\n\nSo cheap ???????\n\n\n\n  The land acquisition is in line with Mah Sing&#39;s strategy of quick turnaround, as registration of interest is expected to be in the first half of 2024.\n\n  Tan said that the stated purchase price was reasonable.\n\n  &quot;Recent sales in Pulai ranged from RM20 to RM25 psf. We believe that the pricing of RM23 psf is suitable for Mah Sing to create its M-series,&quot; he added.\n\n  Analysts are particularly optimistic about Mah Sing&#39;s purchase of land in Pulai since it will allow the company to extend its M-series of affordable housing projects.\n\n  According to MIDF Research, the land cost to GDV is appealing at 16 per cent of the project&#39;s overall value.\n\n  Additionally, it anticipates a minimal impact on the balance sheet. \n\n  &quot;Post-acquisition, we estimate net gearing to increase marginally to 0.22 times from 0.2 times in the first quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, we do not foresee earnings impact in the near term as the project is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.\n\nHence, we make no changes to our earnings forecast,&quot; MIDF said in a note.\n\n  The research house has maintained its &quot;Buy&quot; call on Mah Sing with an unchanged target price of 75 sen.\n\n  It continues to be optimistic about Mah Sing, as it believes that new sales prospects for Mah Sing will be driven by the introduction of properties at reasonable prices. \n\n  The strategic location and affordable purchase price of the planned acquisition have TA Securities feeling optimistic as well. \n\n  The research firm said that in accordance with the anticipated GDV of RM480 million, the land cost accounts for 15.9 per cent  of the entire development value.\n\n  &quot;As the land cost to GDV ratio comes below the general rule of thumb of 20 per cent, we deem the acquisition price reasonable,&quot; it said.\n\n  The positive take-up rate of 85–95 per cent for Mah Sing&#39;s new launches in the first quarter of 2023, demonstrates the persistent demand for affordable housing in urban areas, according to TA Securities.\n\n<img src='https://i.ibb.co/M6TbQLQ/Screenshot-20240121-230514-Chrome.jpg' border='0' alt='user posted image' />","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Sun, 21 Jan 2024 23:10:31 +0800"}

The road in front of our house is actually one-way road (enough to fit one car), but because they used my driveway, so it become two-way (enough for two cars).\n\nBecause it has been like this for many years, so I don&#39;t think I can take it back to make fence, and it is not nice to neighbours too. So, can I get some compensation from Government as that piece of land is belong to my family and now has been used as public road?\n\nAny input are welcome, thanks a lot&#33;","author":"gsstars","pubDate":"Wed, 17 Jan 2024 17:02:12 +0800"}

Business costs, political stability, and pro-business policies are the factors to take into account,&quot; he told NST Property.\n\n  Tan said that Mah Sing may be able to generate positive sales from its proposed development, given that the land is in an excellent location close to Lima Kedai, where there is a decent mix of low- to high-income groups.\n\n\n  Lima Kedai is a crucial transit hub for those using the Second Link Motorway.\n\n  According to Tan, there are numerous employment hubs in and near Pulai, including Southern Industrial Logistics and Clusters (SiLC), Nusajaya Tech Park, Tanjung Bin, and the Port of Tanjung Pelepas, which are increasing demand for houses.\n\n\n  Mah Sing paid RM 76.09 million, or RM23 per square foot (psf), for 30.63 hectares   (  75.68 acres)    in Pulai to expand its M-series.\n\n  It plans to introduce M Tiara, a community of \n\ndouble-storey cluster homes (32&#39;x70&#39;/75&#39;) and\n\n2240 sq ft\n\n\n double-storey terraced homes (20&#39;/22&#39;x70&#39;), \n\n\n1400 sq ft\n\n\nwith a gross development value (GDV) of RM480 million.\n\n\n\n\n  According to Mah Sing&#39;s statement yesterday, the most affordable residential units are anticipated to cost RM624,800.\n\n\nSo cheap ???????\n\n\n\n  The land acquisition is in line with Mah Sing&#39;s strategy of quick turnaround, as registration of interest is expected to be in the first half of 2024.\n\n  Tan said that the stated purchase price was reasonable.\n\n  &quot;Recent sales in Pulai ranged from RM20 to RM25 psf. We believe that the pricing of RM23 psf is suitable for Mah Sing to create its M-series,&quot; he added.\n\n  Analysts are particularly optimistic about Mah Sing&#39;s purchase of land in Pulai since it will allow the company to extend its M-series of affordable housing projects.\n\n  According to MIDF Research, the land cost to GDV is appealing at 16 per cent of the project&#39;s overall value.\n\n  Additionally, it anticipates a minimal impact on the balance sheet. \n\n  &quot;Post-acquisition, we estimate net gearing to increase marginally to 0.22 times from 0.2 times in the first quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, we do not foresee earnings impact in the near term as the project is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.\n\nHence, we make no changes to our earnings forecast,&quot; MIDF said in a note.\n\n  The research house has maintained its &quot;Buy&quot; call on Mah Sing with an unchanged target price of 75 sen.\n\n  It continues to be optimistic about Mah Sing, as it believes that new sales prospects for Mah Sing will be driven by the introduction of properties at reasonable prices. \n\n  The strategic location and affordable purchase price of the planned acquisition have TA Securities feeling optimistic as well. \n\n  The research firm said that in accordance with the anticipated GDV of RM480 million, the land cost accounts for 15.9 per cent  of the entire development value.\n\n  &quot;As the land cost to GDV ratio comes below the general rule of thumb of 20 per cent, we deem the acquisition price reasonable,&quot; it said.\n\n  The positive take-up rate of 85–95 per cent for Mah Sing&#39;s new launches in the first quarter of 2023, demonstrates the persistent demand for affordable housing in urban areas, according to TA Securities.","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Sun, 21 Jan 2024 23:10:31 +0800"}

For example, some of their land is located in matured areas such as [Bandar] Kinrara [in Puchong, Selangor], we want to sweat the land more,” Khor told a news conference after the group’s extraordinary general meeting (EGM) yesterday.\n\n“This would be our area of focus for the next few months and once we get the plans in place, we will push ahead with the execution. So, the first half of 2018 would be [about] planning and the second half through  2019 would see us rolling out a lot of projects,” he added.\n\nS P Setia on June 22 entered into a conditional share purchase agreement to acquire I&amp;P from PNB for RM3.65 billion. In conjunction with the acquisitions, the group proposed a fundraising exercise to raise up to RM3.6 billion.\n\nEarlier at the EGM, S P Setia shareholders gave the nod for the acquisition and fundraising exercise.\n\nAs for manpower allocation after the acquisition, Khor said a reorganisation structure in terms of job allocation had already been put in place for 2018.\n\n“From the beginning of next year, certain units will be spearheaded by the I&amp;P team and certain units by the S P Setia team, with staff of I&amp;P coming in for I&amp;P projects and certain I&amp;P staff will be incorporated into the main Setia team. \n\nAll these have been discussed, thought through and ready for implementation,” he added.\n\nS P Setia shareholders also gave the nod for the group’s acquisition of a 342.5-acre piece of land in Bangi, Selangor from Seriemas Development Sdn Bhd, an indirect subsidiary of PNB, for RM447.58 million. For clarity, the Bangi land is already included in the group’s 9,728 acres of land bank.\n\nThe proposed development in Bangi is expected to generate an estimated gross development value of RM2.74 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Khor said it is too early to discuss the group’s sales target for 2018.\n\n“It is too early to say as we are focusing on achieving this year’s sales target of RM4 billion, but we will not do less than this year,” he said. For the first nine months of this year, S P Setia has secured RM2.82 billion in sales.\n\nCurrently, S P Setia has a total unbilled sales of RM7.05 billion, anchored by 31 ongoing projects.\n\nOn the outlook for the property market, Khor believes it will pick up in 2018.\n\n“Whether it’s a very slow or strong pickup that depends on whether there are catalysts to drive the market.\n\n“A lot of people are saying that [property purchases] have been held back due to the [imminent] elections and after elections there could be a strong pickup. I think these are the catalysts or factors affecting the market,” he said.\n\n“At the moment, [the market] is quite flat, but every time we launch any landed properties with mid-range [pricing] the demand is there,” added Khor.\n\nS P Setia shares closed 13 sen or 3.81% higher at RM3.54 yesterday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM10.28 billion.\n\n\n","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Tue, 13 Feb 2024 09:54:58 +0800"}

He added that rentals were currently higher than the pre-Covid period.\n\n&quot;Last year and this year we saw an increase in rental rates. During MCO the rental rate was low but it is picking up.

Located on high altitude, residents enjoy the close proximity to Johor Bahru’s new premier business and leisure cities ie. Pandan, Tebrau, Ulu Tiram and Plentong, thanks to the well developed access and highways.\n\nA popular choice within the Johor Bahru - Kota Tinggi corridor, offers limitless opportunities in terms of job availability, education, medical services, shopping and recreations. \n\n\nNumerous bus and taxi services run their operations along the corridor, making public transportation a popular alternative. \n\n\nMalaysia’s ‘giants’ in retail industry such as  Lotus&#39;s and Mydin hypermarkets can be found nearby Taman Pelangi Indah, while SONG MART and Pandan wet markets are traditionally a popular choice for locals.\n\n\nLotus&#39;s Plentong\nLot 34, Jalan Masai, Batu 10, Masai, 81750 Johor Bahru\n\n\n\nAEON Tebrau City which hosted JUSCO department store is a must for those seeking retail and entertainment therapy as it also offers a 10-hall Cineplex and a popular karaoke joint. \n\nClose by, Regency Specialist Hospital and Hospital Sultan Ismail offer the best in service and value when it comes to medical care. Education is another hub-in-the making with schools and colleges efficiently linked within the area. \n\nSunway College which started its operation in year 2006, is a top choice for students who wish to further their education closer to home.\n\n\nTwo recreational lakes totaling more than 40 acres act as the green oasis and meeting points for many residents; it’s a place where children run freely and community lifestyle are showcased at its best.\n\n\n\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: S P Setia Bhd, which will get a 78% land bank boost from its acquisition of I&amp;P Group Sdn Bhd from Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB), is in no rush to start developing the new sites.\n\nS P Setia president and chief executive officer Datuk Khor Chap Jen said it will not be developing the land aggressively in the first half of 2018, but instead will meticulously plan its developments in order to add value.\n\n\n\nThe country’s biggest listed developer by sales is set to increase its land bank in the Klang Valley and Johor from 5,452 acres (2,206.34ha) to 9,728 acres,\n\n\n following the completion of its acquisition of I&amp;P by year end — which will propel it to become the country’s third largest property developer by land bank\n\n after Sime Darby Property Bhd\n and\n UEM Sunrise Bhd.\n\n\n\n“The first thing that we will do is to review all the plans that they (I&amp;P) have, and we definitely want to add value ... we think we can add more value to their land. For example, some of their land is located in matured areas such as [Bandar] Kinrara [in Puchong, Selangor], we want to sweat the land more,” Khor told a news conference after the group’s extraordinary general meeting (EGM) yesterday.\n\n“This would be our area of focus for the next few months and once we get the plans in place, we will push ahead with the execution. So, the first half of 2018 would be [about] planning and the second half through  2019 would see us rolling out a lot of projects,” he added.\n\nS P Setia on June 22 entered into a conditional share purchase agreement to acquire I&amp;P from PNB for RM3.65 billion. In conjunction with the acquisitions, the group proposed a fundraising exercise to raise up to RM3.6 billion.\n\nEarlier at the EGM, S P Setia shareholders gave the nod for the acquisition and fundraising exercise.\n\nAs for manpower allocation after the acquisition, Khor said a reorganisation structure in terms of job allocation had already been put in place for 2018.\n\n“From the beginning of next year, certain units will be spearheaded by the I&amp;P team and certain units by the S P Setia team, with staff of I&amp;P coming in for I&amp;P projects and certain I&amp;P staff will be incorporated into the main Setia team. \n\nAll these have been discussed, thought through and ready for implementation,” he added.\n\nS P Setia shareholders also gave the nod for the group’s acquisition of a 342.5-acre piece of land in Bangi, Selangor from Seriemas Development Sdn Bhd, an indirect subsidiary of PNB, for RM447.58 million. For clarity, the Bangi land is already included in the group’s 9,728 acres of land bank.\n\nThe proposed development in Bangi is expected to generate an estimated gross development value of RM2.74 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Khor said it is too early to discuss the group’s sales target for 2018.\n\n“It is too early to say as we are focusing on achieving this year’s sales target of RM4 billion, but we will not do less than this year,” he said. For the first nine months of this year, S P Setia has secured RM2.82 billion in sales.\n\nCurrently, S P Setia has a total unbilled sales of RM7.05 billion, anchored by 31 ongoing projects.\n\nOn the outlook for the property market, Khor believes it will pick up in 2018.\n\n“Whether it’s a very slow or strong pickup that depends on whether there are catalysts to drive the market.\n\n“A lot of people are saying that [property purchases] have been held back due to the [imminent] elections and after elections there could be a strong pickup. I think these are the catalysts or factors affecting the market,” he said.\n\n“At the moment, [the market] is quite flat, but every time we launch any landed properties with mid-range [pricing] the demand is there,” added Khor.\n\nS P Setia shares closed 13 sen or 3.81% higher at RM3.54 yesterday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM10.28 billion.","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Tue, 13 Feb 2024 09:54:58 +0800"}

He added that rentals were currently higher than the pre-Covid period.\n\n&quot;Last year and this year we saw an increase in rental rates. During MCO the rental rate was low but it is picking up. The rental rate (now) is higher than during the pre-Covid period,&quot; he said.\n\n&quot;Areas that are picking up quickly include Bangsar, Bangsar South, Month Kiara, Damansara Heights and KLCC,&quot; said Kiang, who has been in the real estate line for five years.\n\nProperty negotiator Nurrul Nadia Syidha Abd Raoof said it was normal for rentals to go up every year, especially when the economy grows.","author":"contestchris","pubDate":"Thu, 15 Feb 2024 13:48:16 +0800"}
