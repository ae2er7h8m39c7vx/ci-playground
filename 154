Also considering other factors such as Landed Property expansions, Covid Recovery, RTS etc<br />I&#39;m not familiar with real estate market so I&#39;m genuinely asking what would the future trend of prices. I would like to use this info to decide to buy the subsale unit for own stay and possibly renting it out in the future if I ever decide to move back to KL. I&#39;m not desperate to buy a house as I&#39;ve already owned one and fully paid in KL. But if the monthly installment+maintenance is going to be at least equal to or less than the rental then I see why not to buy one. More so, the units look well-renovated and fully furnished.</i><br /><br /><b>CONTEXT<br /></b><br />I&#39;ve relocated from KL to Setia Tropika about 1.5 years ago and been renting here since in one of the apartments called Sky Garden Residence ( another neighbouring apartment Sky Peak Residence)<br />I love this place, a lot of shops within walking distance, right at PLUS exit, and within a 15-20mins drive to all major towns in Johor Metro (Kulai, Senai, Skudai, Dato Onn, Austin, Tebrau, Southkey, JB)<br />Also relaxing 15-30mins drive to/from work in Senai.<br /><br />2022 - I rented a 3+1, 1200 sqft unit, fully furnished, 2 car park unit for rm1300. for rental renewal, my landlord increased the rental to rm1700, He told me he had to because his instalment is very high (not my problem, lol). So I moved out to another unit in the same apartment.<br />2023 - 2+1, 1000 sqft, FF, 1 car park  - rm1500.<br />2024 - looking at the rental rate for the similar unit I have now, it seems like nothing less than rm1800, so I kind of have these feeling my current landlord will up the rental rate.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been looking at the sub-sale prices and it seems to be going down since 2022. My first rented unit was going for RM480K, even when I moved out my landlord offered me a similar rate and then went down to RM450K when I ignored the 1st offer. And this was in April 2023.<br />Currently, I&#39;ve been seeing these units going for RM420K. 2+1 units (similar to the one I&#39;m renting now) are going for RM380K. Neighbouring apartment Sky Peak seeing a similar trend, though it&#39;s slightly more expensive than Sky Garden.<br /><br /><b>Rental rates are going up but subsale prices are going down? Why?</b>[I]<br /><br />Now, I just saw that SP Setia going to build another apartment right between Sky Garden and Sky Peak. I checked with them, the max price will be RM550K for 3-bedroom units 850sqft.<br />There is another apartment across the PLUS highway called D&#39;Secret Garden 2 by KSL that is under construction, right next to 6-year-old D&#39;Secret Garden 1.","author":"Kakistok","pubDate":"Sun, 10 Dec 2023 15:07:37 +0800"}

Apparently, this husband (second husband) has history of abusing the wife, and this is the first time the wife reporting on her husband.<br /><br />Thank god the access card and keys are with the wife. Tenancy agreement is signed under the husband&#39;s name and the agreement is with the wife as well. She wants to change the agreement to her name. I have the rental and utilities deposit, but the deposit is transferred to me via the husband&#39;s account.

Business costs, political stability, and pro-business policies are the factors to take into account,&quot; he told NST Property.\n\n  Tan said that Mah Sing may be able to generate positive sales from its proposed development, given that the land is in an excellent location close to Lima Kedai, where there is a decent mix of low- to high-income groups.\n\n\n  Lima Kedai is a crucial transit hub for those using the Second Link Motorway.\n\n  According to Tan, there are numerous employment hubs in and near Pulai, including Southern Industrial Logistics and Clusters (SiLC), Nusajaya Tech Park, Tanjung Bin, and the Port of Tanjung Pelepas, which are increasing demand for houses.\n\n\n  Mah Sing paid RM 76.09 million, or RM23 per square foot (psf), for 30.63 hectares   (  75.68 acres)    in Pulai to expand its M-series.\n\n  It plans to introduce M Tiara, a community of \n\ndouble-storey cluster homes (32&#39;x70&#39;/75&#39;) and\n\n2240 sq ft\n\n\n double-storey terraced homes (20&#39;/22&#39;x70&#39;), \n\n\n1400 sq ft\n\n\nwith a gross development value (GDV) of RM480 million.\n\n\n\n\n  According to Mah Sing&#39;s statement yesterday, the most affordable residential units are anticipated to cost RM624,800.\n\n\nSo cheap ???????\n\n\n\n  The land acquisition is in line with Mah Sing&#39;s strategy of quick turnaround, as registration of interest is expected to be in the first half of 2024.\n\n  Tan said that the stated purchase price was reasonable.\n\n  &quot;Recent sales in Pulai ranged from RM20 to RM25 psf. We believe that the pricing of RM23 psf is suitable for Mah Sing to create its M-series,&quot; he added.\n\n  Analysts are particularly optimistic about Mah Sing&#39;s purchase of land in Pulai since it will allow the company to extend its M-series of affordable housing projects.\n\n  According to MIDF Research, the land cost to GDV is appealing at 16 per cent of the project&#39;s overall value.\n\n  Additionally, it anticipates a minimal impact on the balance sheet. \n\n  &quot;Post-acquisition, we estimate net gearing to increase marginally to 0.22 times from 0.2 times in the first quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, we do not foresee earnings impact in the near term as the project is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.\n\nHence, we make no changes to our earnings forecast,&quot; MIDF said in a note.\n\n  The research house has maintained its &quot;Buy&quot; call on Mah Sing with an unchanged target price of 75 sen.\n\n  It continues to be optimistic about Mah Sing, as it believes that new sales prospects for Mah Sing will be driven by the introduction of properties at reasonable prices. \n\n  The strategic location and affordable purchase price of the planned acquisition have TA Securities feeling optimistic as well. \n\n  The research firm said that in accordance with the anticipated GDV of RM480 million, the land cost accounts for 15.9 per cent  of the entire development value.\n\n  &quot;As the land cost to GDV ratio comes below the general rule of thumb of 20 per cent, we deem the acquisition price reasonable,&quot; it said.\n\n  The positive take-up rate of 85–95 per cent for Mah Sing&#39;s new launches in the first quarter of 2023, demonstrates the persistent demand for affordable housing in urban areas, according to TA Securities.\n\n<img src='https://i.ibb.co/M6TbQLQ/Screenshot-20240121-230514-Chrome.jpg' border='0' alt='user posted image' />","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Sun, 21 Jan 2024 23:10:31 +0800"}

The road in front of our house is actually one-way road (enough to fit one car), but because they used my driveway, so it become two-way (enough for two cars).\n\nBecause it has been like this for many years, so I don&#39;t think I can take it back to make fence, and it is not nice to neighbours too. So, can I get some compensation from Government as that piece of land is belong to my family and now has been used as public road?\n\nAny input are welcome, thanks a lot&#33;","author":"gsstars","pubDate":"Wed, 17 Jan 2024 17:02:12 +0800"}

Business costs, political stability, and pro-business policies are the factors to take into account,&quot; he told NST Property.\n\n  Tan said that Mah Sing may be able to generate positive sales from its proposed development, given that the land is in an excellent location close to Lima Kedai, where there is a decent mix of low- to high-income groups.\n\n\n  Lima Kedai is a crucial transit hub for those using the Second Link Motorway.\n\n  According to Tan, there are numerous employment hubs in and near Pulai, including Southern Industrial Logistics and Clusters (SiLC), Nusajaya Tech Park, Tanjung Bin, and the Port of Tanjung Pelepas, which are increasing demand for houses.\n\n\n  Mah Sing paid RM 76.09 million, or RM23 per square foot (psf), for 30.63 hectares   (  75.68 acres)    in Pulai to expand its M-series.\n\n  It plans to introduce M Tiara, a community of \n\ndouble-storey cluster homes (32&#39;x70&#39;/75&#39;) and\n\n2240 sq ft\n\n\n double-storey terraced homes (20&#39;/22&#39;x70&#39;), \n\n\n1400 sq ft\n\n\nwith a gross development value (GDV) of RM480 million.\n\n\n\n\n  According to Mah Sing&#39;s statement yesterday, the most affordable residential units are anticipated to cost RM624,800.\n\n\nSo cheap ???????\n\n\n\n  The land acquisition is in line with Mah Sing&#39;s strategy of quick turnaround, as registration of interest is expected to be in the first half of 2024.\n\n  Tan said that the stated purchase price was reasonable.\n\n  &quot;Recent sales in Pulai ranged from RM20 to RM25 psf. We believe that the pricing of RM23 psf is suitable for Mah Sing to create its M-series,&quot; he added.\n\n  Analysts are particularly optimistic about Mah Sing&#39;s purchase of land in Pulai since it will allow the company to extend its M-series of affordable housing projects.\n\n  According to MIDF Research, the land cost to GDV is appealing at 16 per cent of the project&#39;s overall value.\n\n  Additionally, it anticipates a minimal impact on the balance sheet. \n\n  &quot;Post-acquisition, we estimate net gearing to increase marginally to 0.22 times from 0.2 times in the first quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, we do not foresee earnings impact in the near term as the project is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.\n\nHence, we make no changes to our earnings forecast,&quot; MIDF said in a note.\n\n  The research house has maintained its &quot;Buy&quot; call on Mah Sing with an unchanged target price of 75 sen.\n\n  It continues to be optimistic about Mah Sing, as it believes that new sales prospects for Mah Sing will be driven by the introduction of properties at reasonable prices. \n\n  The strategic location and affordable purchase price of the planned acquisition have TA Securities feeling optimistic as well. \n\n  The research firm said that in accordance with the anticipated GDV of RM480 million, the land cost accounts for 15.9 per cent  of the entire development value.\n\n  &quot;As the land cost to GDV ratio comes below the general rule of thumb of 20 per cent, we deem the acquisition price reasonable,&quot; it said.\n\n  The positive take-up rate of 85–95 per cent for Mah Sing&#39;s new launches in the first quarter of 2023, demonstrates the persistent demand for affordable housing in urban areas, according to TA Securities.","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Sun, 21 Jan 2024 23:10:31 +0800"}

For example, some of their land is located in matured areas such as [Bandar] Kinrara [in Puchong, Selangor], we want to sweat the land more,” Khor told a news conference after the group’s extraordinary general meeting (EGM) yesterday.\n\n“This would be our area of focus for the next few months and once we get the plans in place, we will push ahead with the execution. So, the first half of 2018 would be [about] planning and the second half through  2019 would see us rolling out a lot of projects,” he added.\n\nS P Setia on June 22 entered into a conditional share purchase agreement to acquire I&amp;P from PNB for RM3.65 billion. In conjunction with the acquisitions, the group proposed a fundraising exercise to raise up to RM3.6 billion.\n\nEarlier at the EGM, S P Setia shareholders gave the nod for the acquisition and fundraising exercise.\n\nAs for manpower allocation after the acquisition, Khor said a reorganisation structure in terms of job allocation had already been put in place for 2018.\n\n“From the beginning of next year, certain units will be spearheaded by the I&amp;P team and certain units by the S P Setia team, with staff of I&amp;P coming in for I&amp;P projects and certain I&amp;P staff will be incorporated into the main Setia team. \n\nAll these have been discussed, thought through and ready for implementation,” he added.\n\nS P Setia shareholders also gave the nod for the group’s acquisition of a 342.5-acre piece of land in Bangi, Selangor from Seriemas Development Sdn Bhd, an indirect subsidiary of PNB, for RM447.58 million. For clarity, the Bangi land is already included in the group’s 9,728 acres of land bank.\n\nThe proposed development in Bangi is expected to generate an estimated gross development value of RM2.74 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Khor said it is too early to discuss the group’s sales target for 2018.\n\n“It is too early to say as we are focusing on achieving this year’s sales target of RM4 billion, but we will not do less than this year,” he said. For the first nine months of this year, S P Setia has secured RM2.82 billion in sales.\n\nCurrently, S P Setia has a total unbilled sales of RM7.05 billion, anchored by 31 ongoing projects.\n\nOn the outlook for the property market, Khor believes it will pick up in 2018.\n\n“Whether it’s a very slow or strong pickup that depends on whether there are catalysts to drive the market.\n\n“A lot of people are saying that [property purchases] have been held back due to the [imminent] elections and after elections there could be a strong pickup. I think these are the catalysts or factors affecting the market,” he said.\n\n“At the moment, [the market] is quite flat, but every time we launch any landed properties with mid-range [pricing] the demand is there,” added Khor.\n\nS P Setia shares closed 13 sen or 3.81% higher at RM3.54 yesterday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM10.28 billion.\n\n\n","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Tue, 13 Feb 2024 09:54:58 +0800"}

He added that rentals were currently higher than the pre-Covid period.\n\n&quot;Last year and this year we saw an increase in rental rates. During MCO the rental rate was low but it is picking up.

Located on high altitude, residents enjoy the close proximity to Johor Bahru’s new premier business and leisure cities ie. Pandan, Tebrau, Ulu Tiram and Plentong, thanks to the well developed access and highways.\n\nA popular choice within the Johor Bahru - Kota Tinggi corridor, offers limitless opportunities in terms of job availability, education, medical services, shopping and recreations. \n\n\nNumerous bus and taxi services run their operations along the corridor, making public transportation a popular alternative. \n\n\nMalaysia’s ‘giants’ in retail industry such as  Lotus&#39;s and Mydin hypermarkets can be found nearby Taman Pelangi Indah, while SONG MART and Pandan wet markets are traditionally a popular choice for locals.\n\n\nLotus&#39;s Plentong\nLot 34, Jalan Masai, Batu 10, Masai, 81750 Johor Bahru\n\n\n\nAEON Tebrau City which hosted JUSCO department store is a must for those seeking retail and entertainment therapy as it also offers a 10-hall Cineplex and a popular karaoke joint. \n\nClose by, Regency Specialist Hospital and Hospital Sultan Ismail offer the best in service and value when it comes to medical care. Education is another hub-in-the making with schools and colleges efficiently linked within the area. \n\nSunway College which started its operation in year 2006, is a top choice for students who wish to further their education closer to home.\n\n\nTwo recreational lakes totaling more than 40 acres act as the green oasis and meeting points for many residents; it’s a place where children run freely and community lifestyle are showcased at its best.\n\n\n\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: S P Setia Bhd, which will get a 78% land bank boost from its acquisition of I&amp;P Group Sdn Bhd from Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB), is in no rush to start developing the new sites.\n\nS P Setia president and chief executive officer Datuk Khor Chap Jen said it will not be developing the land aggressively in the first half of 2018, but instead will meticulously plan its developments in order to add value.\n\n\n\nThe country’s biggest listed developer by sales is set to increase its land bank in the Klang Valley and Johor from 5,452 acres (2,206.34ha) to 9,728 acres,\n\n\n following the completion of its acquisition of I&amp;P by year end — which will propel it to become the country’s third largest property developer by land bank\n\n after Sime Darby Property Bhd\n and\n UEM Sunrise Bhd.\n\n\n\n“The first thing that we will do is to review all the plans that they (I&amp;P) have, and we definitely want to add value ... we think we can add more value to their land. For example, some of their land is located in matured areas such as [Bandar] Kinrara [in Puchong, Selangor], we want to sweat the land more,” Khor told a news conference after the group’s extraordinary general meeting (EGM) yesterday.\n\n“This would be our area of focus for the next few months and once we get the plans in place, we will push ahead with the execution. So, the first half of 2018 would be [about] planning and the second half through  2019 would see us rolling out a lot of projects,” he added.\n\nS P Setia on June 22 entered into a conditional share purchase agreement to acquire I&amp;P from PNB for RM3.65 billion. In conjunction with the acquisitions, the group proposed a fundraising exercise to raise up to RM3.6 billion.\n\nEarlier at the EGM, S P Setia shareholders gave the nod for the acquisition and fundraising exercise.\n\nAs for manpower allocation after the acquisition, Khor said a reorganisation structure in terms of job allocation had already been put in place for 2018.\n\n“From the beginning of next year, certain units will be spearheaded by the I&amp;P team and certain units by the S P Setia team, with staff of I&amp;P coming in for I&amp;P projects and certain I&amp;P staff will be incorporated into the main Setia team. \n\nAll these have been discussed, thought through and ready for implementation,” he added.\n\nS P Setia shareholders also gave the nod for the group’s acquisition of a 342.5-acre piece of land in Bangi, Selangor from Seriemas Development Sdn Bhd, an indirect subsidiary of PNB, for RM447.58 million. For clarity, the Bangi land is already included in the group’s 9,728 acres of land bank.\n\nThe proposed development in Bangi is expected to generate an estimated gross development value of RM2.74 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Khor said it is too early to discuss the group’s sales target for 2018.\n\n“It is too early to say as we are focusing on achieving this year’s sales target of RM4 billion, but we will not do less than this year,” he said. For the first nine months of this year, S P Setia has secured RM2.82 billion in sales.\n\nCurrently, S P Setia has a total unbilled sales of RM7.05 billion, anchored by 31 ongoing projects.\n\nOn the outlook for the property market, Khor believes it will pick up in 2018.\n\n“Whether it’s a very slow or strong pickup that depends on whether there are catalysts to drive the market.\n\n“A lot of people are saying that [property purchases] have been held back due to the [imminent] elections and after elections there could be a strong pickup. I think these are the catalysts or factors affecting the market,” he said.\n\n“At the moment, [the market] is quite flat, but every time we launch any landed properties with mid-range [pricing] the demand is there,” added Khor.\n\nS P Setia shares closed 13 sen or 3.81% higher at RM3.54 yesterday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM10.28 billion.","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Tue, 13 Feb 2024 09:54:58 +0800"}

Located on high altitude, residents enjoy the close proximity to Johor Bahru’s new premier business and leisure cities ie. Pandan, Tebrau, Ulu Tiram and Plentong, thanks to the well developed access and highways.\n\nA popular choice within the Johor Bahru - Kota Tinggi corridor, offers limitless opportunities in terms of job availability, education, medical services, shopping and recreations. \n\n\nNumerous bus and taxi services run their operations along the corridor, making public transportation a popular alternative. \n\n\nMalaysia’s ‘giants’ in retail industry such as  Lotus&#39;s and Mydin hypermarkets can be found nearby Taman Pelangi Indah, while SONG MART and Pandan wet markets are traditionally a popular choice for locals.\n\n\nLotus&#39;s Plentong\nLot 34, Jalan Masai, Batu 10, Masai, 81750 Johor Bahru\n\n\n\nAEON Tebrau City which hosted JUSCO department store is a must for those seeking retail and entertainment therapy as it also offers a 10-hall Cineplex and a popular karaoke joint. \n\nClose by, Regency Specialist Hospital and Hospital Sultan Ismail offer the best in service and value when it comes to medical care. Education is another hub-in-the making with schools and colleges efficiently linked within the area. \n\nSunway College which started its operation in year 2006, is a top choice for students who wish to further their education closer to home.\n\n\nTwo recreational lakes totaling more than 40 acres act as the green oasis and meeting points for many residents; it’s a place where children run freely and community lifestyle are showcased at its best.\n\n\n\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: S P Setia Bhd, which will get a 78% land bank boost from its acquisition of I&amp;P Group Sdn Bhd from Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB), is in no rush to start developing the new sites.\n\nS P Setia president and chief executive officer Datuk Khor Chap Jen said it will not be developing the land aggressively in the first half of 2018, but instead will meticulously plan its developments in order to add value.\n\n\n\nThe country’s biggest listed developer by sales is set to increase its land bank in the Klang Valley and Johor from 5,452 acres (2,206.34ha) to 9,728 acres,\n\n\n following the completion of its acquisition of I&amp;P by year end — which will propel it to become the country’s third largest property developer by land bank\n\n after Sime Darby Property Bhd\n and\n UEM Sunrise Bhd.\n\n\n\n“The first thing that we will do is to review all the plans that they (I&amp;P) have, and we definitely want to add value ... we think we can add more value to their land. For example, some of their land is located in matured areas such as [Bandar] Kinrara [in Puchong, Selangor], we want to sweat the land more,” Khor told a news conference after the group’s extraordinary general meeting (EGM) yesterday.\n\n“This would be our area of focus for the next few months and once we get the plans in place, we will push ahead with the execution. So, the first half of 2018 would be [about] planning and the second half through  2019 would see us rolling out a lot of projects,” he added.\n\nS P Setia on June 22 entered into a conditional share purchase agreement to acquire I&amp;P from PNB for RM3.65 billion. In conjunction with the acquisitions, the group proposed a fundraising exercise to raise up to RM3.6 billion.\n\nEarlier at the EGM, S P Setia shareholders gave the nod for the acquisition and fundraising exercise.\n\nAs for manpower allocation after the acquisition, Khor said a reorganisation structure in terms of job allocation had already been put in place for 2018.\n\n“From the beginning of next year, certain units will be spearheaded by the I&amp;P team and certain units by the S P Setia team, with staff of I&amp;P coming in for I&amp;P projects and certain I&amp;P staff will be incorporated into the main Setia team. \n\nAll these have been discussed, thought through and ready for implementation,” he added.\n\nS P Setia shareholders also gave the nod for the group’s acquisition of a 342.5-acre piece of land in Bangi, Selangor from Seriemas Development Sdn Bhd, an indirect subsidiary of PNB, for RM447.58 million. For clarity, the Bangi land is already included in the group’s 9,728 acres of land bank.\n\nThe proposed development in Bangi is expected to generate an estimated gross development value of RM2.74 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Khor said it is too early to discuss the group’s sales target for 2018.\n\n“It is too early to say as we are focusing on achieving this year’s sales target of RM4 billion, but we will not do less than this year,” he said. For the first nine months of this year, S P Setia has secured RM2.82 billion in sales.\n\nCurrently, S P Setia has a total unbilled sales of RM7.05 billion, anchored by 31 ongoing projects.\n\nOn the outlook for the property market, Khor believes it will pick up in 2018.\n\n“Whether it’s a very slow or strong pickup that depends on whether there are catalysts to drive the market.\n\n“A lot of people are saying that [property purchases] have been held back due to the [imminent] elections and after elections there could be a strong pickup. I think these are the catalysts or factors affecting the market,” he said.\n\n“At the moment, [the market] is quite flat, but every time we launch any landed properties with mid-range [pricing] the demand is there,” added Khor.\n\nS P Setia shares closed 13 sen or 3.81% higher at RM3.54 yesterday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM10.28 billion.","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Tue, 13 Feb 2024 09:54:58 +0800"}

Located on high altitude, residents enjoy the close proximity to Johor Bahru’s new premier business and leisure cities ie. Pandan, Tebrau, Ulu Tiram and Plentong, thanks to the well developed access and highways.\n\nA popular choice within the Johor Bahru - Kota Tinggi corridor, offers limitless opportunities in terms of job availability, education, medical services, shopping and recreations. \n\n\nNumerous bus and taxi services run their operations along the corridor, making public transportation a popular alternative. \n\n\nMalaysia’s ‘giants’ in retail industry such as  Lotus&#39;s and Mydin hypermarkets can be found nearby Taman Pelangi Indah, while SONG MART and Pandan wet markets are traditionally a popular choice for locals.\n\n\nLotus&#39;s Plentong\nLot 34, Jalan Masai, Batu 10, Masai, 81750 Johor Bahru\n\n\n\nAEON Tebrau City which hosted JUSCO department store is a must for those seeking retail and entertainment therapy as it also offers a 10-hall Cineplex and a popular karaoke joint. \n\nClose by, Regency Specialist Hospital and Hospital Sultan Ismail offer the best in service and value when it comes to medical care. Education is another hub-in-the making with schools and colleges efficiently linked within the area. \n\nSunway College which started its operation in year 2006, is a top choice for students who wish to further their education closer to home.\n\n\nTwo recreational lakes totaling more than 40 acres act as the green oasis and meeting points for many residents; it’s a place where children run freely and community lifestyle are showcased at its best.\n\n\n\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: S P Setia Bhd, which will get a 78% land bank boost from its acquisition of I&amp;P Group Sdn Bhd from Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB), is in no rush to start developing the new sites.\n\nS P Setia president and chief executive officer Datuk Khor Chap Jen said it will not be developing the land aggressively in the first half of 2018, but instead will meticulously plan its developments in order to add value.\n\n\n\nThe country’s biggest listed developer by sales is set to increase its land bank in the Klang Valley and Johor from 5,452 acres (2,206.34ha) to 9,728 acres,\n\n\n following the completion of its acquisition of I&amp;P by year end — which will propel it to become the country’s third largest property developer by land bank\n\n after Sime Darby Property Bhd\n and\n UEM Sunrise Bhd.\n\n\n\n“The first thing that we will do is to review all the plans that they (I&amp;P) have, and we definitely want to add value ... we think we can add more value to their land. For example, some of their land is located in matured areas such as [Bandar] Kinrara [in Puchong, Selangor], we want to sweat the land more,” Khor told a news conference after the group’s extraordinary general meeting (EGM) yesterday.\n\n“This would be our area of focus for the next few months and once we get the plans in place, we will push ahead with the execution. So, the first half of 2018 would be [about] planning and the second half through  2019 would see us rolling out a lot of projects,” he added.\n\nS P Setia on June 22 entered into a conditional share purchase agreement to acquire I&amp;P from PNB for RM3.65 billion. In conjunction with the acquisitions, the group proposed a fundraising exercise to raise up to RM3.6 billion.\n\nEarlier at the EGM, S P Setia shareholders gave the nod for the acquisition and fundraising exercise.\n\nAs for manpower allocation after the acquisition, Khor said a reorganisation structure in terms of job allocation had already been put in place for 2018.\n\n“From the beginning of next year, certain units will be spearheaded by the I&amp;P team and certain units by the S P Setia team, with staff of I&amp;P coming in for I&amp;P projects and certain I&amp;P staff will be incorporated into the main Setia team. \n\nAll these have been discussed, thought through and ready for implementation,” he added.\n\nS P Setia shareholders also gave the nod for the group’s acquisition of a 342.5-acre piece of land in Bangi, Selangor from Seriemas Development Sdn Bhd, an indirect subsidiary of PNB, for RM447.58 million. For clarity, the Bangi land is already included in the group’s 9,728 acres of land bank.\n\nThe proposed development in Bangi is expected to generate an estimated gross development value of RM2.74 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Khor said it is too early to discuss the group’s sales target for 2018.\n\n“It is too early to say as we are focusing on achieving this year’s sales target of RM4 billion, but we will not do less than this year,” he said. For the first nine months of this year, S P Setia has secured RM2.82 billion in sales.\n\nCurrently, S P Setia has a total unbilled sales of RM7.05 billion, anchored by 31 ongoing projects.\n\nOn the outlook for the property market, Khor believes it will pick up in 2018.\n\n“Whether it’s a very slow or strong pickup that depends on whether there are catalysts to drive the market.\n\n“A lot of people are saying that [property purchases] have been held back due to the [imminent] elections and after elections there could be a strong pickup. I think these are the catalysts or factors affecting the market,” he said.\n\n“At the moment, [the market] is quite flat, but every time we launch any landed properties with mid-range [pricing] the demand is there,” added Khor.\n\nS P Setia shares closed 13 sen or 3.81% higher at RM3.54 yesterday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM10.28 billion.","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Tue, 13 Feb 2024 09:54:58 +0800"}

It is also in line with the group&#39;s wider strategy of continuing to acquire strategically located prime land in Johor Bahru, it said.\n\nThe company said site was near other matured developments such\n\n as Taman Mount Austin and Taman Daya \n\nand hence also offered several important advantages, in particular the sustained potential demand from upgraders in the area desiring to move-up to larger, newer and better designed houses.\n\n“Another source of demand is from young adults planning to move out of their parents&#39; homes without having to leave the comforts of the local support network that they have grown accustomed to.\n\n“Further, the existing population of the surrounding matured housing projects will also form the core catchment area for the proposed development&#39;s commercial components,” it said.\n\nS P Setia was confident that the proposed development of mixed residential and commercial project on the land would be well received, and contribute positively to its future earnings and cash flow.\n\n“The proposed development will also ensure S P Setia&#39;s continuing presence and efforts in building residential properties in Johor,” it said.\n\n\n\n\n\nS P Setia acquires land in Johor\nJanuary 28, 2011 \n\n\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: Top property developer S P Setia Bhd is purchasing a 265.7 acre piece of land in Johor Bahru for RM125.78 million, it told the local bourse on Friday, Jan 28.\n\nIts unit Setia Indah Sdn Bhd had on the same day entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement with Kenyalang Property Development Sdn Bhd for the acquisition, which will be developed into a mixed residential development project.\n\n&quot;The said land is situated in the Tebrau corridor, which is a fast growing area in Johor given increased development activities and new property launches as housing demand has spilled over from the congested Johor Bahru city to this corridor. The group&#39;s matured Setia Indah Johor township is located approximately 10 minutes from the land,&quot; it added.\n\nThe amount is calculated at the rate of RM11 psf based on a net land of 262.519 acres after excluding approximately 3.2 acres reserved for water pipeline.\n\nIn a separate media statement, its president and CEO Tan Sri Liew Kee Sin said the group is looking forward to taking advantage of the exciting happenings in the Iskandar Malaysia region to further broaden and deepen its already dominant position in the state, with about 1,500 acres of undeveloped landbank in Johor Bahru following this latest acquisition.\n\nThe developer believes that the robust Singapore economy will see a more sustainable rate of growth of 4% to 6% and create positive spill-over effects for Johor Bahru.\n\n&quot;The acquisition is in-line with the group&#39;s strategy to continue to grow and strengthen its presence in Johor Bahru. The land&#39;s location within the Tebrau corridor where the S P Setia has established a strong following enables it to tap further into the sustained potential demand from upgraders comprised within the group&#39;s own customer base and the surrounding matured residential areas,&quot; he added.\n\nS P Setia has been present in Johor for more than 13 years and has carved a solid reputation for delivering quality homes in its four ongoing projects, namely Bukit Indah Johor, Setia Indah Johor, Setia Tropika and Setia Eco Gardens.\n\nThe group&#39;s long presence and continuous efforts to create value for all its integrated townships in Johor have resulted in numerous local and international awards along with consistently strong sales.\n\n\n\n\n[UPDATE] S P Setia strengthens presence in Johor, to launch properties with a total GDV of &#036;182 mil this year\n\n4 June 2023\n\n\nAn artist’s impression of the entrance to Callista Green in Taman Rinting (Photo: S P Setia)\n\nSINGAPORE (EDGEPROP) - Johor’s real estate market appears to be on an upward trajectory, prompting developers to launch more projects this financial year, according to industry experts.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAttesting to the optimistic outlook, S P Setia Bhd plans to grow its presence in the southern region with a slew of launches worth a total gross development value (GDV) of RM618.76 million (&#036;182 million) in FY2023.\n\nThe property group has been making its mark in Johor with its diversified high-rises, townships, mixed-use developments and commercial centres since 1995. As at December 2022, the group had 8,489.16 acres of land bank in the state with a total GDV of about RM28.1 billion.\n\nIts well-known projects there include nine masterplan townships and developments in Bukit Indah in Taman Bukit Indah, Iskandar Puteri; Setia Eco Cascadia in Tebrau; Setia Eco Gardens in Gelang Patah; Setia Indah Johor; Setia Tropika; Setia Business Park I and Setia Business Park II; Taman Perling; Taman Rinting; Taman Pelangi; Taman Pelangi Indah I; Taman Industri Jaya; Mukim Tanjung Kupang in Iskandar Puteri; and Mukim Serkat in Pontian.\n\n“There has been a tremendous change [in the southern region’s land- scape] since we entered the Johor market with Bukit Indah,” recalls its divisional general manager Saniman Amat Yusof, who himself is a resident of Bukit Indah.\n\n\n\nSaniman: We are focused on rolling out our bread- and-butter products in the region, which are mainly landed residential properties (Photo: S P Setia) \n\n“Back then, especially in the early 2000s, things were very different, and values have since appreciated ... prices were roughly RM200,000 for landed homes back then but now, they are priced at RM700,000 [on average]. We didn’t have good internet connectivity, had limited accessibility [but are now connected to a network of highways, including the Eastern Dispersal Link (EDL), Lebuhraya Persisiran Pantai (Coastal Highway), PLUS Expressway and the Second Link Expressway]. It was not as vibrant as it is today in terms of retailers and facilities,” he tells The Edge Malaysia during a Microsoft Teams meeting.\n\n“I hardly leave the township for anything else because everything is easily available here. My family is quite pleased as well and my children’s schools are nearby. We would like our customers in Johor to experience the same level of convenience at all our townships, aligning with our tagline of ‘live, learn, work, play’.”\n\nIn 1995, S P Setia acquired 900 acres of land from UEM Land (now UEM Sunrise Bhd) and developed it into a planned housing estate. In 2000, the group bought another 300 acres of land for development purposes. Previously an oil palm estate, Bukit Indah has grown into a vibrant and green settlement spanning 1,521 acres with a total GDV of RM5.2 billion. The township is now home to about 60,000 people, who live in more than 10,000 houses.\n\n“This was our first project in Johor, even before Iskandar Malaysia was mooted. It proceeded to win the Johor State Landscape Award 2001, the National Landscape Competition 2001 and the Best National Landscape Award 2005. Bukit Indah is strategically located in Iskandar Malaysia and is only minutes away from Johor Baru,” says Saniman.\n\nThe property group plans to build on this momentum and establish more developments in their masterplans in the southern region over the short and long term.\n\nSaniman says S P Setia’s plans to roll out a few projects in FY2023, namely Adonis at Taman Rinting; Hazelton and Clymer at Setia Eco Cascadia; Palmwood at Taman Pelangi Indah; and Maple &amp; Pine (Phase 2) at Setia Eco Gardens.\n\n\n\nAn artist’s impression of Adonis in Taman Rinting (Photo: S P Setia)\n\n\nAppearing sanguine about the upcoming launches in the southern region, Saniman elaborates on the group’s overall plans. “We are focused on rolling out our bread-and-butter products in the region, which are mainly landed residential properties [priced from RM600,000], and we are confident they will perform well.\n\n\n The key is to price the products well, even though we are mindful of the rising construction costs [which remains a challenge] and other market factors.”\n\nHe adds that a way to overcome this is by simplifying the design of the units. “We have been injecting more eco-themed, sustainable elements and smart home features, and even allocated spaces for solar panels, rather than adding more elements that are costly. There are alternative smart ways to enhance a home while minimising the overall cost and maintenance.\n\n“So far this year, we have launched cluster homes, Calliandra in Setia Tropika; \n\n\nwe also plan to launch Longevia at the same township next month. \n\nThe response has been really good as they are fully booked. We have also launched super link terraced units in Taman Pelangi Indah, which are also fully booked, followed by Clymer and Hazelton (Phase 2) in February and more units in Taman Rinting.”(  81750 Masai Johor)\n\n\nSaniman also mentions details of upcoming launches, particularly Adonis, which is sprawled on an 831-acre parcel in Taman Rinting and comprises two-storey terraced houses and semi-detached homes.\n\n“We are launching 60 units of Desiran 2 (20ft by 70ft) at Adonis, which have a total GDV of RM43 million, in October. The units will be priced from RM720,000,” he says.\n\n“We will launch 2-storey terraced homes Clymer and Hazelton (specifically subphase Alluvia Phase 3 and Phase 4) in Setia Eco Cascadia, which will account for a total GDV of RM147 million, in 1Q2024. The units will be 20ft by 70ft and 22ft by 70ft, and priced from RM754,800.”\n\nIn September, S P Setia will unveil Palmwood — specifically Palmwood 2 (51 units) — in Taman Pelangi Indah that will have a total GDV of RM45 million. The 28ft by 65ft units will be priced from RM845,200.\n\n“We will also launch Maple and Pine (Phase 2) in Setia Eco Gardens. They will comprise 124 units on 765 acres of land and have a total GDVof RM69 million. Maple 2 [20ft by 65ft] and Pine 2 [18ft by 65ft] homes will be priced from RM616,000 and RM533,000 respectively.\n\n\n\n“We have another undeveloped parcel in Taman Pelangi Indah 2[ 81800 Ulu Tiram,\nJohor Bahru ]\n [of more than 900 acres]. We also have a 300-acre tract in Tanjung Kupang that has been earmarked for industrial development in the long term.”","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Sun, 10 Mar 2024 16:11:41 +0800"}

It will also help to expand the company’s footprint in the city centre,” said MB World executive director Cindi Sim.\n\nAnother major ongoing project by the company in the city centre is the MBW City development, comprising Veranda Residences, Trellis Residences and Avenue Residences with a combined GDV of RM2.2bil.\n\nVeranda Residences (phase one) with a total 649 units and an estimated GDV of RM308mil has been fully sold and is expected to obtain the certificate of completion and compliance by the end of this year.\n\nTrellis Residences offering 1,302 units with an estimated GDV of RM581mil is 90% sold.\n\nAvenue Residences has a total of 1,796 units and an estimated GDV of RM956mil. 51% of the non-bumiputra lots have been booked during its current soft launch period.\n\n The last phase of MBW City, the Veranda Residences (phase two) with a total 649 units and an estimated GDV of RM369mil, is expected to be launched in 2025.\n\n“We are excited with the performance of MBW City and would like to thank RHB Bank that shared the same vision with us and financed the project since we acquired the development land in 2019.\n\n“The bank has stepped up to finance our Pandan Heights project in Pandan City of Johor Baru.\n\n“The project offers 1,012 units and has an estimated GDV of RM490mil. To date, 56% of the non-bumiputra units have been sold since it opened for sale in August,” Sim added.\n\nMB World’s recent projects in Johor Baru also included Sierra Heights, Meldrum Heights, Aliff Heights and Idaman Heights totalling 2,525 units with a combined GDV of RM1.2bil.\n\n“Backed by the support and confidence of all end-financing banks, these projects have been well-received and achieved a high take-up rate.\n\n“This has also proven the potential of the Johor Baru property market, catalysed by the development of Johor Baru-Singapore Rapid Transit System or RTS link,” Sim explained.\n\n\n","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Mon, 11 Mar 2024 02:12:59 +0800"}

It is also in line with the group&#39;s wider strategy of continuing to acquire strategically located prime land in Johor Bahru, it said.\n\nThe company said site was near other matured developments such\n\n as Taman Mount Austin and Taman Daya \n\nand hence also offered several important advantages, in particular the sustained potential demand from upgraders in the area desiring to move-up to larger, newer and better designed houses.\n\n“Another source of demand is from young adults planning to move out of their parents&#39; homes without having to leave the comforts of the local support network that they have grown accustomed to.\n\n“Further, the existing population of the surrounding matured housing projects will also form the core catchment area for the proposed development&#39;s commercial components,” it said.\n\nS P Setia was confident that the proposed development of mixed residential and commercial project on the land would be well received, and contribute positively to its future earnings and cash flow.\n\n“The proposed development will also ensure S P Setia&#39;s continuing presence and efforts in building residential properties in Johor,” it said.\n\n\n\n\n\nS P Setia acquires land in Johor\nJanuary 28, 2011 \n\n\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: Top property developer S P Setia Bhd is purchasing a 265.7 acre piece of land in Johor Bahru for RM125.78 million, it told the local bourse on Friday, Jan 28.\n\nIts unit Setia Indah Sdn Bhd had on the same day entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement with Kenyalang Property Development Sdn Bhd for the acquisition, which will be developed into a mixed residential development project.\n\n&quot;The said land is situated in the Tebrau corridor, which is a fast growing area in Johor given increased development activities and new property launches as housing demand has spilled over from the congested Johor Bahru city to this corridor. The group&#39;s matured Setia Indah Johor township is located approximately 10 minutes from the land,&quot; it added.\n\nThe amount is calculated at the rate of RM11 psf based on a net land of 262.519 acres after excluding approximately 3.2 acres reserved for water pipeline.\n\nIn a separate media statement, its president and CEO Tan Sri Liew Kee Sin said the group is looking forward to taking advantage of the exciting happenings in the Iskandar Malaysia region to further broaden and deepen its already dominant position in the state, with about 1,500 acres of undeveloped landbank in Johor Bahru following this latest acquisition.\n\nThe developer believes that the robust Singapore economy will see a more sustainable rate of growth of 4% to 6% and create positive spill-over effects for Johor Bahru.\n\n&quot;The acquisition is in-line with the group&#39;s strategy to continue to grow and strengthen its presence in Johor Bahru. The land&#39;s location within the Tebrau corridor where the S P Setia has established a strong following enables it to tap further into the sustained potential demand from upgraders comprised within the group&#39;s own customer base and the surrounding matured residential areas,&quot; he added.\n\nS P Setia has been present in Johor for more than 13 years and has carved a solid reputation for delivering quality homes in its four ongoing projects, namely Bukit Indah Johor, Setia Indah Johor, Setia Tropika and Setia Eco Gardens.\n\nThe group&#39;s long presence and continuous efforts to create value for all its integrated townships in Johor have resulted in numerous local and international awards along with consistently strong sales.\n\n\n\n\n[UPDATE] S P Setia strengthens presence in Johor, to launch properties with a total GDV of &#036;182 mil this year\n\n4 June 2023\n\n\nAn artist’s impression of the entrance to Callista Green in Taman Rinting (Photo: S P Setia)\n\nSINGAPORE (EDGEPROP) - Johor’s real estate market appears to be on an upward trajectory, prompting developers to launch more projects this financial year, according to industry experts.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAttesting to the optimistic outlook, S P Setia Bhd plans to grow its presence in the southern region with a slew of launches worth a total gross development value (GDV) of RM618.76 million (&#036;182 million) in FY2023.\n\nThe property group has been making its mark in Johor with its diversified high-rises, townships, mixed-use developments and commercial centres since 1995. As at December 2022, the group had 8,489.16 acres of land bank in the state with a total GDV of about RM28.1 billion.\n\nIts well-known projects there include nine masterplan townships and developments in Bukit Indah in Taman Bukit Indah, Iskandar Puteri; Setia Eco Cascadia in Tebrau; Setia Eco Gardens in Gelang Patah; Setia Indah Johor; Setia Tropika; Setia Business Park I and Setia Business Park II; Taman Perling; Taman Rinting; Taman Pelangi; Taman Pelangi Indah I; Taman Industri Jaya; Mukim Tanjung Kupang in Iskandar Puteri; and Mukim Serkat in Pontian.\n\n“There has been a tremendous change [in the southern region’s land- scape] since we entered the Johor market with Bukit Indah,” recalls its divisional general manager Saniman Amat Yusof, who himself is a resident of Bukit Indah.\n\n\n\nSaniman: We are focused on rolling out our bread- and-butter products in the region, which are mainly landed residential properties (Photo: S P Setia) \n\n“Back then, especially in the early 2000s, things were very different, and values have since appreciated ... prices were roughly RM200,000 for landed homes back then but now, they are priced at RM700,000 [on average]. We didn’t have good internet connectivity, had limited accessibility [but are now connected to a network of highways, including the Eastern Dispersal Link (EDL), Lebuhraya Persisiran Pantai (Coastal Highway), PLUS Expressway and the Second Link Expressway]. It was not as vibrant as it is today in terms of retailers and facilities,” he tells The Edge Malaysia during a Microsoft Teams meeting.\n\n“I hardly leave the township for anything else because everything is easily available here. My family is quite pleased as well and my children’s schools are nearby. We would like our customers in Johor to experience the same level of convenience at all our townships, aligning with our tagline of ‘live, learn, work, play’.”\n\nIn 1995, S P Setia acquired 900 acres of land from UEM Land (now UEM Sunrise Bhd) and developed it into a planned housing estate. In 2000, the group bought another 300 acres of land for development purposes. Previously an oil palm estate, Bukit Indah has grown into a vibrant and green settlement spanning 1,521 acres with a total GDV of RM5.2 billion. The township is now home to about 60,000 people, who live in more than 10,000 houses.\n\n“This was our first project in Johor, even before Iskandar Malaysia was mooted. It proceeded to win the Johor State Landscape Award 2001, the National Landscape Competition 2001 and the Best National Landscape Award 2005. Bukit Indah is strategically located in Iskandar Malaysia and is only minutes away from Johor Baru,” says Saniman.\n\nThe property group plans to build on this momentum and establish more developments in their masterplans in the southern region over the short and long term.\n\nSaniman says S P Setia’s plans to roll out a few projects in FY2023, namely Adonis at Taman Rinting; Hazelton and Clymer at Setia Eco Cascadia; Palmwood at Taman Pelangi Indah; and Maple &amp; Pine (Phase 2) at Setia Eco Gardens.\n\n\n\nAn artist’s impression of Adonis in Taman Rinting (Photo: S P Setia)\n\n\nAppearing sanguine about the upcoming launches in the southern region, Saniman elaborates on the group’s overall plans. “We are focused on rolling out our bread-and-butter products in the region, which are mainly landed residential properties [priced from RM600,000], and we are confident they will perform well.\n\n\n The key is to price the products well, even though we are mindful of the rising construction costs [which remains a challenge] and other market factors.”\n\nHe adds that a way to overcome this is by simplifying the design of the units. “We have been injecting more eco-themed, sustainable elements and smart home features, and even allocated spaces for solar panels, rather than adding more elements that are costly. There are alternative smart ways to enhance a home while minimising the overall cost and maintenance.\n\n“So far this year, we have launched cluster homes, Calliandra in Setia Tropika; \n\n\nwe also plan to launch Longevia at the same township next month. \n\nThe response has been really good as they are fully booked. We have also launched super link terraced units in Taman Pelangi Indah, which are also fully booked, followed by Clymer and Hazelton (Phase 2) in February and more units in Taman Rinting.”(  81750 Masai Johor)\n\n\nSaniman also mentions details of upcoming launches, particularly Adonis, which is sprawled on an 831-acre parcel in Taman Rinting and comprises two-storey terraced houses and semi-detached homes.\n\n“We are launching 60 units of Desiran 2 (20ft by 70ft) at Adonis, which have a total GDV of RM43 million, in October. The units will be priced from RM720,000,” he says.\n\n“We will launch 2-storey terraced homes Clymer and Hazelton (specifically subphase Alluvia Phase 3 and Phase 4) in Setia Eco Cascadia, which will account for a total GDV of RM147 million, in 1Q2024. The units will be 20ft by 70ft and 22ft by 70ft, and priced from RM754,800.”\n\nIn September, S P Setia will unveil Palmwood — specifically Palmwood 2 (51 units) — in Taman Pelangi Indah that will have a total GDV of RM45 million. The 28ft by 65ft units will be priced from RM845,200.\n\n“We will also launch Maple and Pine (Phase 2) in Setia Eco Gardens. They will comprise 124 units on 765 acres of land and have a total GDVof RM69 million. Maple 2 [20ft by 65ft] and Pine 2 [18ft by 65ft] homes will be priced from RM616,000 and RM533,000 respectively.\n\n\n\n“We have another undeveloped parcel in Taman Pelangi Indah 2[ 81800 Ulu Tiram,\nJohor Bahru ]\n [of more than 900 acres].

{"title":"Adidas no more gooding? post 1st loss in 30yr, ","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5445213","description":"HERZOGENAURACH, Germany, March 13 (Reuters) - German sportswear giant Adidas (ADSGn.DE) posted its first annual loss in more than 30 years on Wednesday and warned sales in North America would fall again as sportswear retailers in the U.S. struggle with high inventories.\nAdidas has been battling to right itself after it cut ties with Kanye West in October 2022, suspending sales of the highly profitable Yeezy sneaker line.\n\nIn CEO Bjorn Gulden&#39;s first year in the role, he resumed sales of Yeezy sneakers to clear remaining stock while seeking to boost popular products like Samba and Gazelle shoes, and improve relationships with retailers. Shares in Adidas have staged a recovery, outperforming Nike and Puma since he took over.\n\n&quot;Although by far not good enough, 2023 ended better than what I had expected at the beginning of the year,&quot; Gulden said.\n\nAdidas shares were trading flat as of 1115 GMT.\n\nThis year North America will continue to be weak with Adidas expecting sales to fall by around 5% this year.\n\nLower demand and overstocked stores in the U.S. have weighed on sportswear and apparel companies, and Adidas said sales in North America fell by 21% in the fourth quarter and by 16% over the year.\n\nOverall, Gulden said clearing stock through its outlet stores helped Adidas bring inventories down by 1.5 billion euros in 2023, a 24% decline.\n\nAdidas has flagged shipment delays of two to three weeks due to the Red Sea crisis, and Chief Financial Officer Harm Ohlmeyer said on Wednesday that there could be an impact on working capital if the disruptions continue.\n\n&#39;RIGHT DIRECTION&#39;\n\nAdidas terminates its partnership with American rapper and designer Kanye West\nAdidas merchandise is seen in an Adidas store on the day the German company terminated its partnership with the American rapper and designer Kanye West, now known as Ye, in Garden City, New... Purchase Licensing Rights Read more\nAdidas is gambling that it can claw back market share from rivals even as consumers&#39; overall appetite for sportswear declines, sparking job cuts at Nike.\n\nAdidas expects its underlying business - excluding Yeezy - to improve in 2024, with growth of at least 10% in the second half.\n\nIt has benefited from a trend for low-rise suede &quot;terrace&quot; sneakers like the Samba and Gazelle, and last year ramped up production. That trend helped footwear sales grow by 8% in the fourth quarter, while apparel sales fell 13%.\n&quot;Things have clearly been going in the right direction at Adidas since Bjorn Gulden took over,&quot; said Thomas Joekel, portfolio manager at Union Investment. &quot;Brand heat is increasing, which can also be seen from the fact that fewer products now have to be sold at a discount.&quot;\n\nIn China Adidas expects a stronger recovery, with sales growing at a double-digit rate after an 8% increase in 2023.\n\nAdidas last month set expectations low for its remaining Yeezy products, saying it would sell the sneakers &quot;at least at cost&quot;. It launched its latest drop on Feb. 26, but demand for the shoes is difficult to predict.\n\nThe Yeezy sales are &quot;still a little bit of a wild card,&quot; said Cristina Fernandez, analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, despite the company managing the sales successfully so far.\n\nAdidas made 750 million euros in revenue from Yeezy sales last year, resulting in a 300 million euro profit. The company set aside 140 million euros for donations to charities fighting antisemitism and racism.\n\nAdidas&#39; board will propose an unchanged dividend of 0.70 euros (&#036;0.7650) per share on its 2023 performance despite a net loss of 58 million euros, its first since 1992.\n\n(&#036;1 = 0.9151 euros)","author":"premier239","pubDate":"Thu, 14 Mar 2024 16:52:13 +0800"}

It will also help to expand the company’s footprint in the city centre,” said MB World executive director Cindi Sim.\n\nAnother major ongoing project by the company in the city centre is the MBW City development, comprising Veranda Residences, Trellis Residences and Avenue Residences with a combined GDV of RM2.2bil.\n\nVeranda Residences (phase one) with a total 649 units and an estimated GDV of RM308mil has been fully sold and is expected to obtain the certificate of completion and compliance by the end of this year.\n\nTrellis Residences offering 1,302 units with an estimated GDV of RM581mil is 90% sold.\n\nAvenue Residences has a total of 1,796 units and an estimated GDV of RM956mil. 51% of the non-bumiputra lots have been booked during its current soft launch period.\n\n The last phase of MBW City, the Veranda Residences (phase two) with a total 649 units and an estimated GDV of RM369mil, is expected to be launched in 2025.\n\n“We are excited with the performance of MBW City and would like to thank RHB Bank that shared the same vision with us and financed the project since we acquired the development land in 2019.\n\n“The bank has stepped up to finance our Pandan Heights project in Pandan City of Johor Baru.\n\n“The project offers 1,012 units and has an estimated GDV of RM490mil.

{"title":"Sunway Coachrane, ","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5446358","description":"Sunway City Kuala Lumpur, 19th April, 2021 ~ Sunway Berhad’s (Sunway) wholly-owned subsidiary, Sunway Rahman Putra Sdn Bhd, has today signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement to acquire a 6.59-acre parcel of prime freehold land at Jalan Cochrane, Kuala Lumpur from Mutiara Rini Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Boustead Properties Berhad, for a purchase consideration of RM233.4 million.\nThe land is strategically located for a transit-oriented mixed development comprising serviced apartments with a retail podium and is located directly opposite the Cochrane MRT station and just a stone’s throw away from MyTOWN Shopping Centre. The station is part of the Sungai Buloh-Kajang Line and brings commuters directly to the heart of Kuala Lumpur and other major suburbs like Cheras and Damansara.\nMost significantly, the station is just one stop away from the Tun Razak Exchange (“TRX”), the future International Financial District of Kuala Lumpur, which has now reached its inflection point, with the recent completions of Exchange 106, Menara Prudential and HSBC TRX. TRX is expected to house more than 45,000 employees in the near future.\nCommenting on the acquisition, Sunway Property’s Managing Director, Sarena Cheah said, “We are extremely excited with this acquisition as it will strengthen our presence in this vicinity where we have already developed and invested substantially in the very successful Sunway Velocity and Sunway Velocity TWO, both of which are MSC Cybercentre status developments. We believe the future is even more exciting with the upcoming completions in TRX, which will bring in a substantial population of high income, professional workers. We can imagine them wanting to stay at our proposed development here which is just one station away from TRX, with all the amenities at its doorstep and at a much better value.”\nLocated at the fringe of the Golden Triangle, Cochrane has gentrified substantially over the years with Sunway playing a key role in the process. Sunway Velocity, with a GDV of over RM4.0 billion, is just 200 meters away from the site and is a highly successful integrated development with over 23 acres of freehold land. The development encompasses Sunway Velocity Mall, a 1-million square feet net lettable area shopping mall, Sunway Velocity Hotel, a 350-room hotel, Sunway Medical Centre Velocity, a 240-bed medical centre, Sunway College @ Velocity, two office towers with a total floor area of 375,000 square feet and residential units. The developer’s latest development, Sunway Velocity TWO, with a GDV of RM2 billion, is located on another 8.5-acre site right opposite Sunway Velocity and is linked to 3 MRT and 2 LRT stations.\nThe vendor, Boustead Group, has also developed significant landmarks in the vicinity, with MyTOWN Shopping Centre located just diagonally across this site and One Cochrane Residences further up the road. With the upcoming completion of The Exchange TRX Mall, residents at the proposed development on this site will be spoilt for choice when it comes to retail options.\nParents with school-going children will undoubtedly appreciate the selection of reputable schools that this neighbourhood has to offer, such as Tsun Jin Primary School, Taylor’s International School and Sunway College @ Velocity, all within a 1-km radius.\nConnectivity of the site via major roads is also enviable with Jalan Cochrane feeding traffic to major highways such as the Maju Expressway (MEX), the SMART tunnel and the Sungai Besi Expressway.\nTouching on the proposed development on the site, Sarena said, “The proposed gross development value will be at least RM1.15 billion. The development will comprise serviced apartments that sit on top of a retail podium, which will benefit from road frontages on all four sides of the site.”\nThis acquisition is Master Community Developer, Sunway Property’s, second landbank acquisition for the year and reflects its confidence in the recovery of the property market in the coming years.\nCheah adds, “The property market in Malaysia has experienced several challenging years but we have faith that with economic recovery post-Covid, the demand will return, especially in a strong location such as Cochrane where there is a convergence of convenience and affordability – a combination that has become scarce in strong city locations. This exciting mixed-development will be highly desirable amongst our multiple customer segments.”\nCurrently, Sunway’s total landbank stands at 3,339 acres with a potential gross development value of RM52.1 billion over a total development period of more than 15 years, paving the way for resilient growth.\n\nCite from Sunway Property News \n\n<a href='https://pictr.com/image/Etnx0I' target='_blank'><img src='https://pictr.com/images/2024/03/19/Etnx0I.md.jpg' border='0' alt='user posted image' /></a>","author":"bennomin","pubDate":"Tue, 19 Mar 2024 23:11:43 +0800"}

It is also in line with the group&#39;s wider strategy of continuing to acquire strategically located prime land in Johor Bahru, it said.\n\nThe company said site was near other matured developments such\n\n as Taman Mount Austin and Taman Daya \n\nand hence also offered several important advantages, in particular the sustained potential demand from upgraders in the area desiring to move-up to larger, newer and better designed houses.\n\n“Another source of demand is from young adults planning to move out of their parents&#39; homes without having to leave the comforts of the local support network that they have grown accustomed to.\n\n“Further, the existing population of the surrounding matured housing projects will also form the core catchment area for the proposed development&#39;s commercial components,” it said.\n\nS P Setia was confident that the proposed development of mixed residential and commercial project on the land would be well received, and contribute positively to its future earnings and cash flow.\n\n“The proposed development will also ensure S P Setia&#39;s continuing presence and efforts in building residential properties in Johor,” it said.\n\n\n\n\n\nS P Setia acquires land in Johor\nJanuary 28, 2011 \n\n\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: Top property developer S P Setia Bhd is purchasing a 265.7 acre piece of land in Johor Bahru for RM125.78 million, it told the local bourse on Friday, Jan 28.\n\nIts unit Setia Indah Sdn Bhd had on the same day entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement with Kenyalang Property Development Sdn Bhd for the acquisition, which will be developed into a mixed residential development project.\n\n&quot;The said land is situated in the Tebrau corridor, which is a fast growing area in Johor given increased development activities and new property launches as housing demand has spilled over from the congested Johor Bahru city to this corridor. The group&#39;s matured Setia Indah Johor township is located approximately 10 minutes from the land,&quot; it added.\n\nThe amount is calculated at the rate of RM11 psf based on a net land of 262.519 acres after excluding approximately 3.2 acres reserved for water pipeline.\n\nIn a separate media statement, its president and CEO Tan Sri Liew Kee Sin said the group is looking forward to taking advantage of the exciting happenings in the Iskandar Malaysia region to further broaden and deepen its already dominant position in the state, with about 1,500 acres of undeveloped landbank in Johor Bahru following this latest acquisition.\n\nThe developer believes that the robust Singapore economy will see a more sustainable rate of growth of 4% to 6% and create positive spill-over effects for Johor Bahru.\n\n&quot;The acquisition is in-line with the group&#39;s strategy to continue to grow and strengthen its presence in Johor Bahru. The land&#39;s location within the Tebrau corridor where the S P Setia has established a strong following enables it to tap further into the sustained potential demand from upgraders comprised within the group&#39;s own customer base and the surrounding matured residential areas,&quot; he added.\n\nS P Setia has been present in Johor for more than 13 years and has carved a solid reputation for delivering quality homes in its four ongoing projects, namely Bukit Indah Johor, Setia Indah Johor, Setia Tropika and Setia Eco Gardens.\n\nThe group&#39;s long presence and continuous efforts to create value for all its integrated townships in Johor have resulted in numerous local and international awards along with consistently strong sales.\n\n\n\n\n[UPDATE] S P Setia strengthens presence in Johor, to launch properties with a total GDV of &#036;182 mil this year\n\n4 June 2023\n\n\nAn artist’s impression of the entrance to Callista Green in Taman Rinting (Photo: S P Setia)\n\nSINGAPORE (EDGEPROP) - Johor’s real estate market appears to be on an upward trajectory, prompting developers to launch more projects this financial year, according to industry experts.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAttesting to the optimistic outlook, S P Setia Bhd plans to grow its presence in the southern region with a slew of launches worth a total gross development value (GDV) of RM618.76 million (&#036;182 million) in FY2023.\n\nThe property group has been making its mark in Johor with its diversified high-rises, townships, mixed-use developments and commercial centres since 1995. As at December 2022, the group had 8,489.16 acres of land bank in the state with a total GDV of about RM28.1 billion.\n\nIts well-known projects there include nine masterplan townships and developments in Bukit Indah in Taman Bukit Indah, Iskandar Puteri; Setia Eco Cascadia in Tebrau; Setia Eco Gardens in Gelang Patah; Setia Indah Johor; Setia Tropika; Setia Business Park I and Setia Business Park II; Taman Perling; Taman Rinting; Taman Pelangi; Taman Pelangi Indah I; Taman Industri Jaya; Mukim Tanjung Kupang in Iskandar Puteri; and Mukim Serkat in Pontian.\n\n“There has been a tremendous change [in the southern region’s land- scape] since we entered the Johor market with Bukit Indah,” recalls its divisional general manager Saniman Amat Yusof, who himself is a resident of Bukit Indah.\n\n\n\nSaniman: We are focused on rolling out our bread- and-butter products in the region, which are mainly landed residential properties (Photo: S P Setia) \n\n“Back then, especially in the early 2000s, things were very different, and values have since appreciated ... prices were roughly RM200,000 for landed homes back then but now, they are priced at RM700,000 [on average]. We didn’t have good internet connectivity, had limited accessibility [but are now connected to a network of highways, including the Eastern Dispersal Link (EDL), Lebuhraya Persisiran Pantai (Coastal Highway), PLUS Expressway and the Second Link Expressway]. It was not as vibrant as it is today in terms of retailers and facilities,” he tells The Edge Malaysia during a Microsoft Teams meeting.\n\n“I hardly leave the township for anything else because everything is easily available here. My family is quite pleased as well and my children’s schools are nearby. We would like our customers in Johor to experience the same level of convenience at all our townships, aligning with our tagline of ‘live, learn, work, play’.”\n\nIn 1995, S P Setia acquired 900 acres of land from UEM Land (now UEM Sunrise Bhd) and developed it into a planned housing estate. In 2000, the group bought another 300 acres of land for development purposes. Previously an oil palm estate, Bukit Indah has grown into a vibrant and green settlement spanning 1,521 acres with a total GDV of RM5.2 billion. The township is now home to about 60,000 people, who live in more than 10,000 houses.\n\n“This was our first project in Johor, even before Iskandar Malaysia was mooted. It proceeded to win the Johor State Landscape Award 2001, the National Landscape Competition 2001 and the Best National Landscape Award 2005. Bukit Indah is strategically located in Iskandar Malaysia and is only minutes away from Johor Baru,” says Saniman.\n\nThe property group plans to build on this momentum and establish more developments in their masterplans in the southern region over the short and long term.\n\nSaniman says S P Setia’s plans to roll out a few projects in FY2023, namely Adonis at Taman Rinting; Hazelton and Clymer at Setia Eco Cascadia; Palmwood at Taman Pelangi Indah; and Maple &amp; Pine (Phase 2) at Setia Eco Gardens.\n\n\n\nAn artist’s impression of Adonis in Taman Rinting (Photo: S P Setia)\n\n\nAppearing sanguine about the upcoming launches in the southern region, Saniman elaborates on the group’s overall plans. “We are focused on rolling out our bread-and-butter products in the region, which are mainly landed residential properties [priced from RM600,000], and we are confident they will perform well.\n\n\n The key is to price the products well, even though we are mindful of the rising construction costs [which remains a challenge] and other market factors.”\n\nHe adds that a way to overcome this is by simplifying the design of the units. “We have been injecting more eco-themed, sustainable elements and smart home features, and even allocated spaces for solar panels, rather than adding more elements that are costly. There are alternative smart ways to enhance a home while minimising the overall cost and maintenance.\n\n“So far this year, we have launched cluster homes, Calliandra in Setia Tropika; \n\n\nwe also plan to launch Longevia at the same township next month. \n\nThe response has been really good as they are fully booked. We have also launched super link terraced units in Taman Pelangi Indah, which are also fully booked, followed by Clymer and Hazelton (Phase 2) in February and more units in Taman Rinting.”(  81750 Masai Johor)\n\n\nSaniman also mentions details of upcoming launches, particularly Adonis, which is sprawled on an 831-acre parcel in Taman Rinting and comprises two-storey terraced houses and semi-detached homes.\n\n“We are launching 60 units of Desiran 2 (20ft by 70ft) at Adonis, which have a total GDV of RM43 million, in October. The units will be priced from RM720,000,” he says.\n\n“We will launch 2-storey terraced homes Clymer and Hazelton (specifically subphase Alluvia Phase 3 and Phase 4) in Setia Eco Cascadia, which will account for a total GDV of RM147 million, in 1Q2024. The units will be 20ft by 70ft and 22ft by 70ft, and priced from RM754,800.”\n\nIn September, S P Setia will unveil Palmwood — specifically Palmwood 2 (51 units) — in Taman Pelangi Indah that will have a total GDV of RM45 million. The 28ft by 65ft units will be priced from RM845,200.\n\n“We will also launch Maple and Pine (Phase 2) in Setia Eco Gardens. They will comprise 124 units on 765 acres of land and have a total GDVof RM69 million. Maple 2 [20ft by 65ft] and Pine 2 [18ft by 65ft] homes will be priced from RM616,000 and RM533,000 respectively.\n\n\n\n“We have another undeveloped parcel in Taman Pelangi Indah 2[ 81800 Ulu Tiram,\nJohor Bahru ]\n [of more than 900 acres]. We also have a 300-acre tract in Tanjung Kupang that has been earmarked for industrial development in the long term.”","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Sun, 10 Mar 2024 16:11:41 +0800"}

{"title":"Sunway Coachrane, ","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5446358","description":"Sunway City Kuala Lumpur, 19th April, 2021 ~ Sunway Berhad’s (Sunway) wholly-owned subsidiary, Sunway Rahman Putra Sdn Bhd, has today signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement to acquire a 6.59-acre parcel of prime freehold land at Jalan Cochrane, Kuala Lumpur from Mutiara Rini Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Boustead Properties Berhad, for a purchase consideration of RM233.4 million.\nThe land is strategically located for a transit-oriented mixed development comprising serviced apartments with a retail podium and is located directly opposite the Cochrane MRT station and just a stone’s throw away from MyTOWN Shopping Centre. The station is part of the Sungai Buloh-Kajang Line and brings commuters directly to the heart of Kuala Lumpur and other major suburbs like Cheras and Damansara.\nMost significantly, the station is just one stop away from the Tun Razak Exchange (“TRX”), the future International Financial District of Kuala Lumpur, which has now reached its inflection point, with the recent completions of Exchange 106, Menara Prudential and HSBC TRX. TRX is expected to house more than 45,000 employees in the near future.\nCommenting on the acquisition, Sunway Property’s Managing Director, Sarena Cheah said, “We are extremely excited with this acquisition as it will strengthen our presence in this vicinity where we have already developed and invested substantially in the very successful Sunway Velocity and Sunway Velocity TWO, both of which are MSC Cybercentre status developments. We believe the future is even more exciting with the upcoming completions in TRX, which will bring in a substantial population of high income, professional workers. We can imagine them wanting to stay at our proposed development here which is just one station away from TRX, with all the amenities at its doorstep and at a much better value.”\nLocated at the fringe of the Golden Triangle, Cochrane has gentrified substantially over the years with Sunway playing a key role in the process. Sunway Velocity, with a GDV of over RM4.0 billion, is just 200 meters away from the site and is a highly successful integrated development with over 23 acres of freehold land. The development encompasses Sunway Velocity Mall, a 1-million square feet net lettable area shopping mall, Sunway Velocity Hotel, a 350-room hotel, Sunway Medical Centre Velocity, a 240-bed medical centre, Sunway College @ Velocity, two office towers with a total floor area of 375,000 square feet and residential units. The developer’s latest development, Sunway Velocity TWO, with a GDV of RM2 billion, is located on another 8.5-acre site right opposite Sunway Velocity and is linked to 3 MRT and 2 LRT stations.\nThe vendor, Boustead Group, has also developed significant landmarks in the vicinity, with MyTOWN Shopping Centre located just diagonally across this site and One Cochrane Residences further up the road. With the upcoming completion of The Exchange TRX Mall, residents at the proposed development on this site will be spoilt for choice when it comes to retail options.\nParents with school-going children will undoubtedly appreciate the selection of reputable schools that this neighbourhood has to offer, such as Tsun Jin Primary School, Taylor’s International School and Sunway College @ Velocity, all within a 1-km radius.\nConnectivity of the site via major roads is also enviable with Jalan Cochrane feeding traffic to major highways such as the Maju Expressway (MEX), the SMART tunnel and the Sungai Besi Expressway.\nTouching on the proposed development on the site, Sarena said, “The proposed gross development value will be at least RM1.15 billion. The development will comprise serviced apartments that sit on top of a retail podium, which will benefit from road frontages on all four sides of the site.”\nThis acquisition is Master Community Developer, Sunway Property’s, second landbank acquisition for the year and reflects its confidence in the recovery of the property market in the coming years.\nCheah adds, “The property market in Malaysia has experienced several challenging years but we have faith that with economic recovery post-Covid, the demand will return, especially in a strong location such as Cochrane where there is a convergence of convenience and affordability – a combination that has become scarce in strong city locations. This exciting mixed-development will be highly desirable amongst our multiple customer segments.”\nCurrently, Sunway’s total landbank stands at 3,339 acres with a potential gross development value of RM52.1 billion over a total development period of more than 15 years, paving the way for resilient growth.\n\nCite from Sunway Property News \n\n<a href='https://pictr.com/image/Etnx0I' target='_blank'><img src='https://pictr.com/images/2024/03/19/Etnx0I.md.jpg' border='0' alt='user posted image' /></a>","author":"bennomin","pubDate":"Tue, 19 Mar 2024 23:11:43 +0800"}

I believe Setia Eco Cascadia also has not much empty land left.\n\nAccording to a report from Kuala Lumpur dated January 5th, 2024, Scientex Berhad&#39;s second attempt to purchase prime land in Johor Bahru from SP Setia Berhad, this time for RM548 million, has fallen through again. Scientex first attempted to acquire the Johor land in 2021 for RM518.1 million. However, the deal fell through in March 2023 after it failed to obtain a waiver of\n\nthe Bumiputera equity condition imposed by the Economic Planning Unit (EPU). In July 2023, both parties revisited the deal, with a new price tag of RM547.65 million.\n\nOn Friday, Scientex and SP Setia stated in Bursa filings that the deal to purchase the freehold 960-acre land in Tebrau was terminated due to non-fulfillment of the conditions precedent within the extended completion period.\n\n\nAccording to SP Setia, the disposal was terminated as Scientex&#39;s unit, Scientex Lestari Sdn Bhd, was unable to obtain EPU approval for the acquisition. Scientex mentioned that SP Setia will refund the deposit paid, along with the accrued interest, as per the terms of the sale and purchase agreement (SPA).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCould Kulai, Kangkar Pulai, Masai or Ulu Tiram become the next successful townships on the outskirts of Johor Bahru since most of the land in JB has been utilized from 2020 to 2024?","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Mon, 08 Apr 2024 20:12:01 +0800"}

It is also surrounded by colourful gardens, lush greenery and pristine lakes.\n\nThe township is near Spring Labs, a retail concept park that has picturesque spots, cafés and restaurants that are aesthetically pleasing.\n\nAnother commercial hotspot within the vicinity is Eco Palladium, a hub that will be filled with F&amp;B outlets, retail shops and services, education institutions and wellness centres.\n\n\nEco Summer is a 200-acre garden-concept residential development situated in Tebrau, Johor, launched at the same time as its 400-acre fraternal twin township Eco Spring and projected to be completed around the same time too, in May 2017. \n\n\nOnce entering the gated and guarded borders of the development, Eco Summer’s 50-foot-wide roads lead past vistas of colourful, summery flowers and vibrant greenery.\n\n\n Residents will also enjoy facilities like a basketball court, playground, function lawn and an outdoor fitness deck with gymnasium. \n\nThe Eco Summer development is divided into two halves – the North Garden and South Garden. \n\nBoth portions offer double-storey link houses in the style of English colonial bungalows and townhouses\n\n\n\nSetia Eco Garden,\nTaman Nusa Sentral,\nHorizon Hills,\nEco Botanic,\nEco Summer,\nEco Spring,\nAdda heights,\n\n\n were built between 2000 and 2024.\n\nMany shop lots, gated and guarded condo, double-storey clusters and terrace houses, and semi-detached and three-storey or two-storey bungalows have been selling like hotcakes.\n\n\n \n\n\nWhy SP Setia Berhad is now only focusing on Taman Rinting, Masai and Setia Eco Gardens in the Johor Bahru area?\n\n\nLeft is only one new Taman Perling condo not yet launched.\n\n\nDo they still have land in Taman Perling?\n\nIs it because the Johor Bahru market is currently not favorable, so they want to sell their land in Tebrau to Scientex Bhd?\n\nNow, Setia Tropika and Bukit Indah have only a few percent of undeveloped land left. I believe Setia Eco Cascadia also has not much empty land left.\n\nAccording to a report from Kuala Lumpur dated January 5th, 2024, Scientex Berhad&#39;s second attempt to purchase prime land in Johor Bahru from SP Setia Berhad, this time for RM548 million, has fallen through again. Scientex first attempted to acquire the Johor land in 2021 for RM518.1 million. However, the deal fell through in March 2023 after it failed to obtain a waiver of\n\nthe Bumiputera equity condition imposed by the Economic Planning Unit (EPU). In July 2023, both parties revisited the deal, with a new price tag of RM547.65 million.\n\nOn Friday, Scientex and SP Setia stated in Bursa filings that the deal to purchase the freehold 960-acre land in Tebrau was terminated due to non-fulfillment of the conditions precedent within the extended completion period.\n\n\nAccording to SP Setia, the disposal was terminated as Scientex&#39;s unit, Scientex Lestari Sdn Bhd, was unable to obtain EPU approval for the acquisition. Scientex mentioned that SP Setia will refund the deposit paid, along with the accrued interest, as per the terms of the sale and purchase agreement (SPA).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCould Kulai, Kangkar Pulai, Masai or Ulu Tiram become the next successful townships on the outskirts of Johor Bahru since most of the land in JB has been utilized from 2020 to 2024?","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Mon, 08 Apr 2024 20:12:01 +0800"}

It is also surrounded by colourful gardens, lush greenery and pristine lakes.\n\nThe township is near Spring Labs, a retail concept park that has picturesque spots, cafés and restaurants that are aesthetically pleasing.\n\nAnother commercial hotspot within the vicinity is Eco Palladium, a hub that will be filled with F&amp;B outlets, retail shops and services, education institutions and wellness centres.\n\n\nEco Summer is a 200-acre garden-concept residential development situated in Tebrau, Johor, launched at the same time as its 400-acre fraternal twin township Eco Spring and projected to be completed around the same time too, in May 2017. \n\n\nOnce entering the gated and guarded borders of the development, Eco Summer’s 50-foot-wide roads lead past vistas of colourful, summery flowers and vibrant greenery.\n\n\n Residents will also enjoy facilities like a basketball court, playground, function lawn and an outdoor fitness deck with gymnasium. \n\nThe Eco Summer development is divided into two halves – the North Garden and South Garden. \n\nBoth portions offer double-storey link houses in the style of English colonial bungalows and townhouses\n\n\n\nSetia Eco Garden,\nTaman Nusa Sentral,\nHorizon Hills,\nEco Botanic,\nEco Summer,\nEco Spring,\nAdda heights,\n\n\n were built between 2000 and 2024.\n\nMany shop lots, gated and guarded condo, double-storey clusters and terrace houses, and semi-detached and three-storey or two-storey bungalows have been selling like hotcakes.\n\n\n \n\n\nWhy SP Setia Berhad is now only focusing on Taman Rinting, Masai and Setia Eco Gardens in the Johor Bahru area?\n\n\nLeft is only one new Taman Perling condo not yet launched.\n\n\nDo they still have land in Taman Perling?\n\nIs it because the Johor Bahru market is currently not favorable, so they want to sell their land in Tebrau to Scientex Bhd?\n\nNow, Setia Tropika and Bukit Indah have only a few percent of undeveloped land left. I believe Setia Eco Cascadia also has not much empty land left.\n\nAccording to a report from Kuala Lumpur dated January 5th, 2024, Scientex Berhad&#39;s second attempt to purchase prime land in Johor Bahru from SP Setia Berhad, this time for RM548 million, has fallen through again. Scientex first attempted to acquire the Johor land in 2021 for RM518.1 million. However, the deal fell through in March 2023 after it failed to obtain a waiver of\n\nthe Bumiputera equity condition imposed by the Economic Planning Unit (EPU). In July 2023, both parties revisited the deal, with a new price tag of RM547.65 million.\n\nOn Friday, Scientex and SP Setia stated in Bursa filings that the deal to purchase the freehold 960-acre land in Tebrau was terminated due to non-fulfillment of the conditions precedent within the extended completion period.\n\n\nAccording to SP Setia, the disposal was terminated as Scientex&#39;s unit, Scientex Lestari Sdn Bhd, was unable to obtain EPU approval for the acquisition. Scientex mentioned that SP Setia will refund the deposit paid, along with the accrued interest, as per the terms of the sale and purchase agreement (SPA).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCould Kulai, Kangkar Pulai, Masai or Ulu Tiram become the next successful townships on the outskirts of Johor Bahru since most of the land in JB has been utilized from 2020 to 2024?","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Mon, 08 Apr 2024 20:12:01 +0800"}

However the current owner stated that he and his family will only move out in Mid January 2025, pending the completion of his new place. The agent had said we could sign the S&amp;P stating when the property will be handed over to me, and all I need to do is pay 10% and bank will only disburse on the mentioned date. \nIs there a downside of doing this, what precautions should I take or should I avoid this altogether?

Actually, I paid the balance in 2nd month, but the lawyer took 1m+ to get land office to approve everything.\n\nThis month is the 4th month and bank haven&#39;t release the loan yet, the seller is insist to charge purchaser late interests. May i seek advice from you all.\n\nShould I pay this and this is my fault or there is reason due to the lawyer firm took more than a month to get the Land office to approve SNP, geran and etc.\n\nMay I know in what condition the late interest should be beared by the lawyer instead of buyer? If i am not wrong after the 3+1 (4months) we can ask compensation from the lawyer, how about if there is delay and everything settle in the 4th month, the late interest of 4th month buyer must pay it? is there any law that can fight for this late charge? because seller insist and dont compromise.  \n\n\nI&#39;m buying actually loan 78% and 22% is the balance.\n\nOur SNP is done and the 10% I paid at the first month.\n\nMay I know the land office to proceed the SNP, before this lawyer must need to receive 22% or 10% is already enough ?\n\n\nAs in the SNP is clearly state that I paid 10%...myself pay the balance of another 12% after 1and half month. So the lawyer took another 1.5m+++ at land office which causes delays... I wanna emphasize that the total balance of 22% lawyer receive after 1.5months but 10% deposit like SNP stated I already paid when we sign it.

Actually, I paid the balance in 2nd month, but the lawyer took 1m+ to get land office to approve everything.\n\nThis month is the 4th month and bank haven&#39;t release the loan yet, the seller is insist to charge purchaser late interests. May i seek advice from you all.\n\nShould I pay this and this is my fault or there is reason due to the lawyer firm took more than a month to get the Land office to approve SNP, geran and etc.\n\nMay I know in what condition the late interest should be beared by the lawyer instead of buyer? If i am not wrong after the 3+1 (4months) we can ask compensation from the lawyer, how about if there is delay and everything settle in the 4th month, the late interest of 4th month buyer must pay it? is there any law that can fight for this late charge? because seller insist and dont compromise.  \n\n\nI&#39;m buying actually loan 78% and 22% is the balance.\n\nOur SNP is done and the 10% I paid at the first month.\n\nMay I know the land office to proceed the SNP, before this lawyer must need to receive 22% or 10% is already enough ?\n\n\nAs in the SNP is clearly state that I paid 10%...myself pay the balance of another 12% after 1and half month. So the lawyer took another 1.5m+++ at land office which causes delays... I wanna emphasize that the total balance of 22% lawyer receive after 1.5months but 10% deposit like SNP stated I already paid when we sign it.

The celebration here marks the official topping-out of the iconic Space Residency apartment’s 61st floor.\n\n“This achievement is attributed to the close cooperation between the experienced project team, contractors, and professional consultants from Linbaq Holding and Giant Leap Construction Sdn Bhd.\n\n\n\n<img src='https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/original/07/074127/074127a_hb_ro_054.jpg' border='0' alt='user posted image' />\n\n“The topping-out of Space Residency signifies another important milestone jointly achieved by Linbaq Holding and Giant Leap in the property development and construction industry,” he said.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Chan also presented awards to Giant Leap on behalf of Linbaq Holding to acknowledge it hard work and dedication.\n\nThe awards were given to Giant Leap managing director Huang Kewei, the company’s deputy general manager Ding Xiulong and its project manager Voon Khian Ngiap.\n\nAlso present were Linbaq Holding’s two deputy chief operating officers Grant Kok Chun Siong and Ng Chong Seng as well as its financial controller Lim Wei Xiang.\n\nSpace Residency is Linbaq Holdings flagship project in Johor Baru and comprises serviced apartments, commercial space, tourism, leisure and entertainment elements.\n\nThe project will include South-East Asia’s first Carton King Theme Park and Street Mall, Johor Baru’s highest commercial space, and the Novotel hotel, an international hotel from Europe.\n\nThe Space Residency has 61 floors and a total height of 230m, with the top three floors being the city’s highest commercial zone.\n\nSpace Residency’s serviced apartments were fully sold out even during the construction phase, making it the first project in Johor Baru to achieve a complete sell-out before completion.\n\n\nNot yet include Larkin area.........\n\nSo many condo at johor bahru custom area&#33;&#33;&#33;\n\n\nS P setia,Tropicana,KSL\nMB world/SKS group,\n\nHuayang,\n, R &amp; F, Country Garden\nCrescendo,\n\nJo Land group(related to Paragon Globe Bhd)\nMaxim Global Berhad\n\n\n10 listed companies &#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\n(MB WORLD already delisted)..........","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 10:48:17 +0800"}

Actually, I paid the balance in 2nd month, but the lawyer took 1m+ to get land office to approve everything.\n\nThis month is the 4th month and bank haven&#39;t release the loan yet, the seller is insist to charge purchaser late interests. May i seek advice from you all.\n\nShould I pay this and this is my fault or there is reason due to the lawyer firm took more than a month to get the Land office to approve SNP, geran and etc.\n\nMay I know in what condition the late interest should be beared by the lawyer instead of buyer? If i am not wrong after the 3+1 (4months) we can ask compensation from the lawyer, how about if there is delay and everything settle in the 4th month, the late interest of 4th month buyer must pay it? is there any law that can fight for this late charge? because seller insist and dont compromise.  \n\n\nI&#39;m buying actually loan 78% and 22% is the balance.\n\nOur SNP is done and the 10% I paid at the first month.\n\nMay I know the land office to proceed the SNP, before this lawyer must need to receive 22% or 10% is already enough ?\n\n\nAs in the SNP is clearly state that I paid 10%...myself pay the balance of another 12% after 1and half month. So the lawyer took another 1.5m+++ at land office which causes delays... I wanna emphasize that the total balance of 22% lawyer receive after 1.5months but 10% deposit like SNP stated I already paid when we sign it. So whose fault for causing it to take 3+1 months \n\n\nMay I know based on my scenario is it lawyer should bear the cost or we buyer must pay late interest which I think not fair&#33; Right now seller insists want it","author":"ComputerIdiot","pubDate":"Mon, 01 Jul 2024 17:06:36 +0800"}

Without everyone’s hard work, we would not have achieved such excellent results today.\n\n“Moving forward, we will continue to strive to deliver the best quality houses to our customers,” he said after the topping out ceremony here recently, which was completed with a symbolic pouring of cement.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Linbaq Holding chief operating officer Lawrence Chan Kok Liang said the hotel at Space Regency, once completed, will be the tallest hotel in Johor.\n\n“The Novotel Hotel [ Accor Group ]  had its topping out ceremony in April last year. The celebration here marks the official topping-out of the iconic Space Residency apartment’s 61st floor.\n\n“This achievement is attributed to the close cooperation between the experienced project team, contractors, and professional consultants from Linbaq Holding and Giant Leap Construction Sdn Bhd.\n\n\n\n<img src='https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/original/07/074127/074127a_hb_ro_054.jpg' border='0' alt='user posted image' />\n\n“The topping-out of Space Residency signifies another important milestone jointly achieved by Linbaq Holding and Giant Leap in the property development and construction industry,” he said.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Chan also presented awards to Giant Leap on behalf of Linbaq Holding to acknowledge it hard work and dedication.\n\nThe awards were given to Giant Leap managing director Huang Kewei, the company’s deputy general manager Ding Xiulong and its project manager Voon Khian Ngiap.\n\nAlso present were Linbaq Holding’s two deputy chief operating officers Grant Kok Chun Siong and Ng Chong Seng as well as its financial controller Lim Wei Xiang.\n\nSpace Residency is Linbaq Holdings flagship project in Johor Baru and comprises serviced apartments, commercial space, tourism, leisure and entertainment elements.\n\nThe project will include South-East Asia’s first Carton King Theme Park and Street Mall, Johor Baru’s highest commercial space, and the Novotel hotel, an international hotel from Europe.\n\nThe Space Residency has 61 floors and a total height of 230m, with the top three floors being the city’s highest commercial zone.\n\nSpace Residency’s serviced apartments were fully sold out even during the construction phase, making it the first project in Johor Baru to achieve a complete sell-out before completion.\n\n\nNot yet include Larkin area.........\n\nSo many condo at johor bahru custom area&#33;&#33;&#33;\n\n\nS P setia,Tropicana,KSL\nMB world/SKS group,\n\nHuayang,\n, R &amp; F, Country Garden\nCrescendo,\n\nJo Land group(related to Paragon Globe Bhd)\nMaxim Global Berhad\n\n\n10 listed companies &#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\n(MB WORLD already delisted)..........","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 10:48:17 +0800"}

{"title":"Old House vs New Project same Taman, which would you prefer and why","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5468126","description":"First off, no right or wrong to this discussion, just people with different views and preferences.\n\nSo let&#39;s say in the same development/master plan, there is existing completed units sub-sale, and around 5 minutes away by car, the developer has new project launch which will require you to wait &lt; 3 years. Subsale unit is also &quot;outer&quot;, nearer to the main roads, and new project a bit more &quot;inside&quot;. Just imagine it is 1 extra traffic light for the new project to the main road.\n\n20x75 for RM500k nett, completed 10 years ago\n20x70 for RM600k, new project, RM540k nett after discount etc.\n\nLet&#39;s assume, in terms of layout, both are 4R3B, can park 2 cars in tandem by default. Slight variation in terms of the floor plan but basically comparable. Of course the old unit has a bit more usable space and 5 feet extra land.\n\nYou can see, touch, feel the subsale, you like it, obviously it is a bit old, paint needs to be refreshed. Biggest benefit is you know what exactly you are getting, and price wise it is cheaper by RM40k. And you also seen the neighbours and let&#39;s say you are happy with them -- no big dogs barking, don&#39;t have neighbour with 6 cars parking the whole road.\n\nWhich would you prefer to buy and why? \n","author":"Jason","pubDate":"Tue, 09 Jul 2024 13:04:59 +0800"}

Two small toilets and I was charged RM1900. \n\nOne of the two toilets have leaked, hence I decided to approach others. \n\nOne foreigner quoted me RM2,500 for one 8*5 feet toilet while the local quoted me RM3,500. \n\nHow is it possible that this is now so expensive?

{"title":"[Subsale]3+1 Delay issue, seller insist to charge, Seek for help","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5466602","description":"Hello Sifus here, would like to consult something,  recently I have purchased a subsale condo.\n\nThe agreed SNP for both party is 3 months after SNP is signed. Actually, I paid the balance in 2nd month, but the lawyer took 1m+ to get land office to approve everything.\n\nThis month is the 4th month and bank haven&#39;t release the loan yet, the seller is insist to charge purchaser late interests. May i seek advice from you all.\n\nShould I pay this and this is my fault or there is reason due to the lawyer firm took more than a month to get the Land office to approve SNP, geran and etc.\n\nMay I know in what condition the late interest should be beared by the lawyer instead of buyer? If i am not wrong after the 3+1 (4months) we can ask compensation from the lawyer, how about if there is delay and everything settle in the 4th month, the late interest of 4th month buyer must pay it? is there any law that can fight for this late charge? because seller insist and dont compromise.  \n\n\nI&#39;m buying actually loan 78% and 22% is the balance.\n\nOur SNP is done and the 10% I paid at the first month.\n\nMay I know the land office to proceed the SNP, before this lawyer must need to receive 22% or 10% is already enough ?\n\n\nAs in the SNP is clearly state that I paid 10%...myself pay the balance of another 12% after 1and half month. So the lawyer took another 1.5m+++ at land office which causes delays... I wanna emphasize that the total balance of 22% lawyer receive after 1.5months but 10% deposit like SNP stated I already paid when we sign it. So whose fault for causing it to take 3+1 months \n\n\nMay I know based on my scenario is it lawyer should bear the cost or we buyer must pay late interest which I think not fair&#33; Right now seller insists want it","author":"ComputerIdiot","pubDate":"Mon, 01 Jul 2024 17:06:36 +0800"}

The celebration here marks the official topping-out of the iconic Space Residency apartment’s 61st floor.\n\n“This achievement is attributed to the close cooperation between the experienced project team, contractors, and professional consultants from Linbaq Holding and Giant Leap Construction Sdn Bhd.\n\n\n\n<img src='https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/original/07/074127/074127a_hb_ro_054.jpg' border='0' alt='user posted image' />\n\n“The topping-out of Space Residency signifies another important milestone jointly achieved by Linbaq Holding and Giant Leap in the property development and construction industry,” he said.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Chan also presented awards to Giant Leap on behalf of Linbaq Holding to acknowledge it hard work and dedication.\n\nThe awards were given to Giant Leap managing director Huang Kewei, the company’s deputy general manager Ding Xiulong and its project manager Voon Khian Ngiap.\n\nAlso present were Linbaq Holding’s two deputy chief operating officers Grant Kok Chun Siong and Ng Chong Seng as well as its financial controller Lim Wei Xiang.\n\nSpace Residency is Linbaq Holdings flagship project in Johor Baru and comprises serviced apartments, commercial space, tourism, leisure and entertainment elements.\n\nThe project will include South-East Asia’s first Carton King Theme Park and Street Mall, Johor Baru’s highest commercial space, and the Novotel hotel, an international hotel from Europe.\n\nThe Space Residency has 61 floors and a total height of 230m, with the top three floors being the city’s highest commercial zone.\n\nSpace Residency’s serviced apartments were fully sold out even during the construction phase, making it the first project in Johor Baru to achieve a complete sell-out before completion.\n\n\nNot yet include Larkin area.........\n\nSo many condo at johor bahru custom area&#33;&#33;&#33;\n\n\nS P setia,Tropicana,KSL\nMB world/SKS group,\n\nHuayang,\n, R &amp; F, Country Garden\nCrescendo,\n\nJo Land group(related to Paragon Globe Bhd)\nMaxim Global Berhad\n\n\n10 listed companies &#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\n(MB WORLD already delisted)..........","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 10:48:17 +0800"}

Subsale unit is also &quot;outer&quot;, nearer to the main roads, and new project a bit more &quot;inside&quot;. Just imagine it is 1 extra traffic light for the new project to the main road.\n\n20x75 for RM500k nett, completed 10 years ago\n20x70 for RM600k, new project, RM540k nett after discount etc.\n\nLet&#39;s assume, in terms of layout, both are 4R3B, can park 2 cars in tandem by default. Slight variation in terms of the floor plan but basically comparable. Of course the old unit has a bit more usable space and 5 feet extra land.\n\nYou can see, touch, feel the subsale, you like it, obviously it is a bit old, paint needs to be refreshed. Biggest benefit is you know what exactly you are getting, and price wise it is cheaper by RM40k. And you also seen the neighbours and let&#39;s say you are happy with them -- no big dogs barking, don&#39;t have neighbour with 6 cars parking the whole road.\n\nWhich would you prefer to buy and why? \n","author":"Jason","pubDate":"Tue, 09 Jul 2024 13:04:59 +0800"}

Actually, I paid the balance in 2nd month, but the lawyer took 1m+ to get land office to approve everything.\n\nThis month is the 4th month and bank haven&#39;t release the loan yet, the seller is insist to charge purchaser late interests. May i seek advice from you all.\n\nShould I pay this and this is my fault or there is reason due to the lawyer firm took more than a month to get the Land office to approve SNP, geran and etc.\n\nMay I know in what condition the late interest should be beared by the lawyer instead of buyer? If i am not wrong after the 3+1 (4months) we can ask compensation from the lawyer, how about if there is delay and everything settle in the 4th month, the late interest of 4th month buyer must pay it? is there any law that can fight for this late charge? because seller insist and dont compromise.  \n\n\nI&#39;m buying actually loan 78% and 22% is the balance.\n\nOur SNP is done and the 10% I paid at the first month.\n\nMay I know the land office to proceed the SNP, before this lawyer must need to receive 22% or 10% is already enough ?\n\n\nAs in the SNP is clearly state that I paid 10%...myself pay the balance of another 12% after 1and half month. So the lawyer took another 1.5m+++ at land office which causes delays... I wanna emphasize that the total balance of 22% lawyer receive after 1.5months but 10% deposit like SNP stated I already paid when we sign it.

Without everyone’s hard work, we would not have achieved such excellent results today.\n\n“Moving forward, we will continue to strive to deliver the best quality houses to our customers,” he said after the topping out ceremony here recently, which was completed with a symbolic pouring of cement.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Linbaq Holding chief operating officer Lawrence Chan Kok Liang said the hotel at Space Regency, once completed, will be the tallest hotel in Johor.\n\n“The Novotel Hotel [ Accor Group ]  had its topping out ceremony in April last year. The celebration here marks the official topping-out of the iconic Space Residency apartment’s 61st floor.\n\n“This achievement is attributed to the close cooperation between the experienced project team, contractors, and professional consultants from Linbaq Holding and Giant Leap Construction Sdn Bhd.\n\n\n\n<img src='https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/original/07/074127/074127a_hb_ro_054.jpg' border='0' alt='user posted image' />\n\n“The topping-out of Space Residency signifies another important milestone jointly achieved by Linbaq Holding and Giant Leap in the property development and construction industry,” he said.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Chan also presented awards to Giant Leap on behalf of Linbaq Holding to acknowledge it hard work and dedication.\n\nThe awards were given to Giant Leap managing director Huang Kewei, the company’s deputy general manager Ding Xiulong and its project manager Voon Khian Ngiap.\n\nAlso present were Linbaq Holding’s two deputy chief operating officers Grant Kok Chun Siong and Ng Chong Seng as well as its financial controller Lim Wei Xiang.\n\nSpace Residency is Linbaq Holdings flagship project in Johor Baru and comprises serviced apartments, commercial space, tourism, leisure and entertainment elements.\n\nThe project will include South-East Asia’s first Carton King Theme Park and Street Mall, Johor Baru’s highest commercial space, and the Novotel hotel, an international hotel from Europe.\n\nThe Space Residency has 61 floors and a total height of 230m, with the top three floors being the city’s highest commercial zone.\n\nSpace Residency’s serviced apartments were fully sold out even during the construction phase, making it the first project in Johor Baru to achieve a complete sell-out before completion.\n\n\nNot yet include Larkin area.........\n\nSo many condo at johor bahru custom area&#33;&#33;&#33;\n\n\nS P setia,Tropicana,KSL\nMB world/SKS group,\n\nHuayang,\n, R &amp; F, Country Garden\nCrescendo,\n\nJo Land group(related to Paragon Globe Bhd)\nMaxim Global Berhad\n\n\n10 listed companies &#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\n(MB WORLD already delisted)..........","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 10:48:17 +0800"}

{"title":"Old House vs New Project same Taman, which would you prefer and why","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5468126","description":"First off, no right or wrong to this discussion, just people with different views and preferences.\n\nSo let&#39;s say in the same development/master plan, there is existing completed units sub-sale, and around 5 minutes away by car, the developer has new project launch which will require you to wait &lt; 3 years. Subsale unit is also &quot;outer&quot;, nearer to the main roads, and new project a bit more &quot;inside&quot;. Just imagine it is 1 extra traffic light for the new project to the main road.\n\n20x75 for RM500k nett, completed 10 years ago\n20x70 for RM600k, new project, RM540k nett after discount etc.\n\nLet&#39;s assume, in terms of layout, both are 4R3B, can park 2 cars in tandem by default. Slight variation in terms of the floor plan but basically comparable. Of course the old unit has a bit more usable space and 5 feet extra land.\n\nYou can see, touch, feel the subsale, you like it, obviously it is a bit old, paint needs to be refreshed. Biggest benefit is you know what exactly you are getting, and price wise it is cheaper by RM40k. And you also seen the neighbours and let&#39;s say you are happy with them -- no big dogs barking, don&#39;t have neighbour with 6 cars parking the whole road.\n\nWhich would you prefer to buy and why? \n","author":"Jason","pubDate":"Tue, 09 Jul 2024 13:04:59 +0800"}

Hacking is not allowed, but &quot;limited hacking&quot; near the switches and &quot;certain locations&quot; might b possible.\n\n1. Are all (or most) condos built via the IBS system? Sorry not from engineering/construction background, hence, not too familiar with the terminologies.\n\n2. Is IBS better or inferior to bricks in terms of heat and noise insulation?\n\n3. What are the other factors that need to be considered for choosing terrace house built via the IBS system completely?\n\nThank you.\n\n","author":"augusta23","pubDate":"Tue, 09 Jul 2024 17:58:34 +0800"}

Actually, I paid the balance in 2nd month, but the lawyer took 1m+ to get land office to approve everything.\n\nThis month is the 4th month and bank haven&#39;t release the loan yet, the seller is insist to charge purchaser late interests. May i seek advice from you all.\n\nShould I pay this and this is my fault or there is reason due to the lawyer firm took more than a month to get the Land office to approve SNP, geran and etc.\n\nMay I know in what condition the late interest should be beared by the lawyer instead of buyer? If i am not wrong after the 3+1 (4months) we can ask compensation from the lawyer, how about if there is delay and everything settle in the 4th month, the late interest of 4th month buyer must pay it? is there any law that can fight for this late charge? because seller insist and dont compromise.  \n\n\nI&#39;m buying actually loan 78% and 22% is the balance.\n\nOur SNP is done and the 10% I paid at the first month.\n\nMay I know the land office to proceed the SNP, before this lawyer must need to receive 22% or 10% is already enough ?\n\n\nAs in the SNP is clearly state that I paid 10%...myself pay the balance of another 12% after 1and half month. So the lawyer took another 1.5m+++ at land office which causes delays... I wanna emphasize that the total balance of 22% lawyer receive after 1.5months but 10% deposit like SNP stated I already paid when we sign it. So whose fault for causing it to take 3+1 months \n\n\nMay I know based on my scenario is it lawyer should bear the cost or we buyer must pay late interest which I think not fair&#33; Right now seller insists want it","author":"ComputerIdiot","pubDate":"Mon, 01 Jul 2024 17:06:36 +0800"}

The celebration here marks the official topping-out of the iconic Space Residency apartment’s 61st floor.\n\n“This achievement is attributed to the close cooperation between the experienced project team, contractors, and professional consultants from Linbaq Holding and Giant Leap Construction Sdn Bhd.\n\n\n\n<img src='https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/original/07/074127/074127a_hb_ro_054.jpg' border='0' alt='user posted image' />\n\n“The topping-out of Space Residency signifies another important milestone jointly achieved by Linbaq Holding and Giant Leap in the property development and construction industry,” he said.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Chan also presented awards to Giant Leap on behalf of Linbaq Holding to acknowledge it hard work and dedication.\n\nThe awards were given to Giant Leap managing director Huang Kewei, the company’s deputy general manager Ding Xiulong and its project manager Voon Khian Ngiap.\n\nAlso present were Linbaq Holding’s two deputy chief operating officers Grant Kok Chun Siong and Ng Chong Seng as well as its financial controller Lim Wei Xiang.\n\nSpace Residency is Linbaq Holdings flagship project in Johor Baru and comprises serviced apartments, commercial space, tourism, leisure and entertainment elements.\n\nThe project will include South-East Asia’s first Carton King Theme Park and Street Mall, Johor Baru’s highest commercial space, and the Novotel hotel, an international hotel from Europe.\n\nThe Space Residency has 61 floors and a total height of 230m, with the top three floors being the city’s highest commercial zone.\n\nSpace Residency’s serviced apartments were fully sold out even during the construction phase, making it the first project in Johor Baru to achieve a complete sell-out before completion.\n\n\nNot yet include Larkin area.........\n\nSo many condo at johor bahru custom area&#33;&#33;&#33;\n\n\nS P setia,Tropicana,KSL\nMB world/SKS group,\n\nHuayang,\n, R &amp; F, Country Garden\nCrescendo,\n\nJo Land group(related to Paragon Globe Bhd)\nMaxim Global Berhad\n\n\n10 listed companies &#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\n(MB WORLD already delisted)..........","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 10:48:17 +0800"}

Subsale unit is also &quot;outer&quot;, nearer to the main roads, and new project a bit more &quot;inside&quot;. Just imagine it is 1 extra traffic light for the new project to the main road.\n\n20x75 for RM500k nett, completed 10 years ago\n20x70 for RM600k, new project, RM540k nett after discount etc.\n\nLet&#39;s assume, in terms of layout, both are 4R3B, can park 2 cars in tandem by default. Slight variation in terms of the floor plan but basically comparable. Of course the old unit has a bit more usable space and 5 feet extra land.\n\nYou can see, touch, feel the subsale, you like it, obviously it is a bit old, paint needs to be refreshed. Biggest benefit is you know what exactly you are getting, and price wise it is cheaper by RM40k. And you also seen the neighbours and let&#39;s say you are happy with them -- no big dogs barking, don&#39;t have neighbour with 6 cars parking the whole road.\n\nWhich would you prefer to buy and why? \n","author":"Jason","pubDate":"Tue, 09 Jul 2024 13:04:59 +0800"}

Actually, I paid the balance in 2nd month, but the lawyer took 1m+ to get land office to approve everything.\n\nThis month is the 4th month and bank haven&#39;t release the loan yet, the seller is insist to charge purchaser late interests. May i seek advice from you all.\n\nShould I pay this and this is my fault or there is reason due to the lawyer firm took more than a month to get the Land office to approve SNP, geran and etc.\n\nMay I know in what condition the late interest should be beared by the lawyer instead of buyer? If i am not wrong after the 3+1 (4months) we can ask compensation from the lawyer, how about if there is delay and everything settle in the 4th month, the late interest of 4th month buyer must pay it? is there any law that can fight for this late charge? because seller insist and dont compromise.  \n\n\nI&#39;m buying actually loan 78% and 22% is the balance.\n\nOur SNP is done and the 10% I paid at the first month.\n\nMay I know the land office to proceed the SNP, before this lawyer must need to receive 22% or 10% is already enough ?\n\n\nAs in the SNP is clearly state that I paid 10%...myself pay the balance of another 12% after 1and half month. So the lawyer took another 1.5m+++ at land office which causes delays... I wanna emphasize that the total balance of 22% lawyer receive after 1.5months but 10% deposit like SNP stated I already paid when we sign it. So whose fault for causing it to take 3+1 months \n\n\nMay I know based on my scenario is it lawyer should bear the cost or we buyer must pay late interest which I think not fair&#33; Right now seller insists want it","author":"ComputerIdiot","pubDate":"Mon, 01 Jul 2024 17:06:36 +0800"}

Without everyone’s hard work, we would not have achieved such excellent results today.\n\n“Moving forward, we will continue to strive to deliver the best quality houses to our customers,” he said after the topping out ceremony here recently, which was completed with a symbolic pouring of cement.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Linbaq Holding chief operating officer Lawrence Chan Kok Liang said the hotel at Space Regency, once completed, will be the tallest hotel in Johor.\n\n“The Novotel Hotel [ Accor Group ]  had its topping out ceremony in April last year. The celebration here marks the official topping-out of the iconic Space Residency apartment’s 61st floor.\n\n“This achievement is attributed to the close cooperation between the experienced project team, contractors, and professional consultants from Linbaq Holding and Giant Leap Construction Sdn Bhd.\n\n\n\n<img src='https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/original/07/074127/074127a_hb_ro_054.jpg' border='0' alt='user posted image' />\n\n“The topping-out of Space Residency signifies another important milestone jointly achieved by Linbaq Holding and Giant Leap in the property development and construction industry,” he said.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Chan also presented awards to Giant Leap on behalf of Linbaq Holding to acknowledge it hard work and dedication.\n\nThe awards were given to Giant Leap managing director Huang Kewei, the company’s deputy general manager Ding Xiulong and its project manager Voon Khian Ngiap.\n\nAlso present were Linbaq Holding’s two deputy chief operating officers Grant Kok Chun Siong and Ng Chong Seng as well as its financial controller Lim Wei Xiang.\n\nSpace Residency is Linbaq Holdings flagship project in Johor Baru and comprises serviced apartments, commercial space, tourism, leisure and entertainment elements.\n\nThe project will include South-East Asia’s first Carton King Theme Park and Street Mall, Johor Baru’s highest commercial space, and the Novotel hotel, an international hotel from Europe.\n\nThe Space Residency has 61 floors and a total height of 230m, with the top three floors being the city’s highest commercial zone.\n\nSpace Residency’s serviced apartments were fully sold out even during the construction phase, making it the first project in Johor Baru to achieve a complete sell-out before completion.\n\n\nNot yet include Larkin area.........\n\nSo many condo at johor bahru custom area&#33;&#33;&#33;\n\n\nS P setia,Tropicana,KSL\nMB world/SKS group,\n\nHuayang,\n, R &amp; F, Country Garden\nCrescendo,\n\nJo Land group(related to Paragon Globe Bhd)\nMaxim Global Berhad\n\n\n10 listed companies &#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\n(MB WORLD already delisted)..........","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 10:48:17 +0800"}

{"title":"Old House vs New Project same Taman, which would you prefer and why","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5468126","description":"First off, no right or wrong to this discussion, just people with different views and preferences.\n\nSo let&#39;s say in the same development/master plan, there is existing completed units sub-sale, and around 5 minutes away by car, the developer has new project launch which will require you to wait &lt; 3 years. Subsale unit is also &quot;outer&quot;, nearer to the main roads, and new project a bit more &quot;inside&quot;. Just imagine it is 1 extra traffic light for the new project to the main road.\n\n20x75 for RM500k nett, completed 10 years ago\n20x70 for RM600k, new project, RM540k nett after discount etc.\n\nLet&#39;s assume, in terms of layout, both are 4R3B, can park 2 cars in tandem by default. Slight variation in terms of the floor plan but basically comparable. Of course the old unit has a bit more usable space and 5 feet extra land.\n\nYou can see, touch, feel the subsale, you like it, obviously it is a bit old, paint needs to be refreshed. Biggest benefit is you know what exactly you are getting, and price wise it is cheaper by RM40k. And you also seen the neighbours and let&#39;s say you are happy with them -- no big dogs barking, don&#39;t have neighbour with 6 cars parking the whole road.\n\nWhich would you prefer to buy and why? \n","author":"Jason","pubDate":"Tue, 09 Jul 2024 13:04:59 +0800"}
{"title":"IBS landed houses, ","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5468191","description":"Hi everyone,\n\nI recently come across a development in which the terraced houses will be built completed using the IBS system in contrast to other developments in the vicinity that are still using bricks.\n\nI was made to understand that it will very similar to condos. Hacking is not allowed, but &quot;limited hacking&quot; near the switches and &quot;certain locations&quot; might b possible.\n\n1. Are all (or most) condos built via the IBS system? Sorry not from engineering/construction background, hence, not too familiar with the terminologies.\n\n2. Is IBS better or inferior to bricks in terms of heat and noise insulation?\n\n3. What are the other factors that need to be considered for choosing terrace house built via the IBS system completely?\n\nThank you.\n\n","author":"augusta23","pubDate":"Tue, 09 Jul 2024 17:58:34 +0800"}

Without everyone’s hard work, we would not have achieved such excellent results today.\n\n“Moving forward, we will continue to strive to deliver the best quality houses to our customers,” he said after the topping out ceremony here recently, which was completed with a symbolic pouring of cement.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Linbaq Holding chief operating officer Lawrence Chan Kok Liang said the hotel at Space Regency, once completed, will be the tallest hotel in Johor.\n\n“The Novotel Hotel [ Accor Group ]  had its topping out ceremony in April last year. The celebration here marks the official topping-out of the iconic Space Residency apartment’s 61st floor.\n\n“This achievement is attributed to the close cooperation between the experienced project team, contractors, and professional consultants from Linbaq Holding and Giant Leap Construction Sdn Bhd.\n\n\n\n<img src='https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/original/07/074127/074127a_hb_ro_054.jpg' border='0' alt='user posted image' />\n\n“The topping-out of Space Residency signifies another important milestone jointly achieved by Linbaq Holding and Giant Leap in the property development and construction industry,” he said.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Chan also presented awards to Giant Leap on behalf of Linbaq Holding to acknowledge it hard work and dedication.\n\nThe awards were given to Giant Leap managing director Huang Kewei, the company’s deputy general manager Ding Xiulong and its project manager Voon Khian Ngiap.\n\nAlso present were Linbaq Holding’s two deputy chief operating officers Grant Kok Chun Siong and Ng Chong Seng as well as its financial controller Lim Wei Xiang.\n\nSpace Residency is Linbaq Holdings flagship project in Johor Baru and comprises serviced apartments, commercial space, tourism, leisure and entertainment elements.\n\nThe project will include South-East Asia’s first Carton King Theme Park and Street Mall, Johor Baru’s highest commercial space, and the Novotel hotel, an international hotel from Europe.\n\nThe Space Residency has 61 floors and a total height of 230m, with the top three floors being the city’s highest commercial zone.\n\nSpace Residency’s serviced apartments were fully sold out even during the construction phase, making it the first project in Johor Baru to achieve a complete sell-out before completion.\n\n\nNot yet include Larkin area.........\n\nSo many condo at johor bahru custom area&#33;&#33;&#33;\n\n\nS P setia,Tropicana,KSL\nMB world/SKS group,\n\nHuayang,\n, R &amp; F, Country Garden\nCrescendo,\n\nJo Land group(related to Paragon Globe Bhd)\nMaxim Global Berhad\n\n\n10 listed companies &#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;\n(MB WORLD already delisted)..........","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 10:48:17 +0800"}

Subsale unit is also &quot;outer&quot;, nearer to the main roads, and new project a bit more &quot;inside&quot;. Just imagine it is 1 extra traffic light for the new project to the main road.\n\n20x75 for RM500k nett, completed 10 years ago\n20x70 for RM600k, new project, RM540k nett after discount etc.\n\nLet&#39;s assume, in terms of layout, both are 4R3B, can park 2 cars in tandem by default. Slight variation in terms of the floor plan but basically comparable. Of course the old unit has a bit more usable space and 5 feet extra land.\n\nYou can see, touch, feel the subsale, you like it, obviously it is a bit old, paint needs to be refreshed. Biggest benefit is you know what exactly you are getting, and price wise it is cheaper by RM40k. And you also seen the neighbours and let&#39;s say you are happy with them -- no big dogs barking, don&#39;t have neighbour with 6 cars parking the whole road.\n\nWhich would you prefer to buy and why? \n","author":"Jason","pubDate":"Tue, 09 Jul 2024 13:04:59 +0800"}

Hacking is not allowed, but &quot;limited hacking&quot; near the switches and &quot;certain locations&quot; might b possible.\n\n1. Are all (or most) condos built via the IBS system? Sorry not from engineering/construction background, hence, not too familiar with the terminologies.\n\n2. Is IBS better or inferior to bricks in terms of heat and noise insulation?\n\n3.

Subsale unit is also &quot;outer&quot;, nearer to the main roads, and new project a bit more &quot;inside&quot;. Just imagine it is 1 extra traffic light for the new project to the main road.\n\n20x75 for RM500k nett, completed 10 years ago\n20x70 for RM600k, new project, RM540k nett after discount etc.\n\nLet&#39;s assume, in terms of layout, both are 4R3B, can park 2 cars in tandem by default. Slight variation in terms of the floor plan but basically comparable. Of course the old unit has a bit more usable space and 5 feet extra land.\n\nYou can see, touch, feel the subsale, you like it, obviously it is a bit old, paint needs to be refreshed. Biggest benefit is you know what exactly you are getting, and price wise it is cheaper by RM40k. And you also seen the neighbours and let&#39;s say you are happy with them -- no big dogs barking, don&#39;t have neighbour with 6 cars parking the whole road.\n\nWhich would you prefer to buy and why? \n","author":"Jason","pubDate":"Tue, 09 Jul 2024 13:04:59 +0800"}

No parking machines but to pay to the reservation counter. I believed it was closed in the morning to avoid public to use the road passing condo to avoid jam.

I thought the lawyer that I hired to represent me shall do the utility accounts&#39; termination? \n\n2. Can I go to TNB and Air Selangor office to terminate it myself? Any advice on what I shall look for? I searched the old LYN post, someone mentioned best to go back to the property and take photo of the meter before proceed to go to the office for termination. \n\n3. Since it is a strata title property, do I need to go to management office to inform them the changes of ownership? And again, I thought this is my lawyer&#39;s task, i dunno why now all are me and I have to take leave for it. \n\nThank you\n\n","author":"FinalHistory","pubDate":"Fri, 26 Jul 2024 00:08:43 +0800"}

It compelled developers to adhere strictly to agreed timelines and provided homebuyers with the assurance of compensation in case of delays.\n\nThis protection was seen as a guard against unscrupulous and profit-oriented developers who might otherwise take advantage of the homebuyers.\n\nHowever, the decision had significant and unintended consequences. The AML ruling applied retrospectively, affecting developers who had secured EOTs before the AML ruling.\n\nThese developers had followed the law and the prescribed procedures to apply for EOTs and for many, had informed homebuyers about the EOTs during the signing of their sale and purchase agreements (SPA).\n\nConsequently, these developers faced lawsuits from homebuyers claiming LAD even when there was no delay since EOTs had been validly granted by the controller.\n\nThe confusion arose from the retrospective effect of the AML ruling. Retrospective rulings mean that a court’s decision applies to events or transactions that occurred even before the ruling was made.\n\nIf a court does not specify whether a ruling should apply prospectively (only to future cases) or retrospectively, the default position generally is retrospective.\n\nIn the AML case, the Federal Court did not clarify this, thus paving the way to a wave of legal challenges and uncertainty for developers.\n\nLandmark ruling\n\nThis legal uncertainty led to the case of Obata-Ambak Holdings Sdn Bhd v Prema Bonanza Sdn Bhd and two other appeals (Obata-Ambak). The developers in these cases appealed to the Federal Court, arguing among others, against the retrospectivity of the AML ruling.\n\nThe developers highlighted the deeply entrenched nature of Regulation 11(3) which had been the basis for the developers to obtain EOTs since 1989.\n\n\n\nToday (July 26), the five-member bench led by the Court of Appeal president Tan Sri Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim held that the AML ruling is to be applied prospectively in the interests of justice.\n\nUnanimously, the Federal Court held that the homebuyers cannot rely on the AML decision as a “carte blanche” to make financial gain against the developers who had at all times complied with the laws that were valid at that material time and obtained EOTs before the AML decision.\n\nThis decision provided relief and finality to developers who had acted in good faith under the previous understanding of the law and applied for EOTs due to genuine need.\n\nIt marked an important clarification by ensuring that developers who had obtained EOTs before the AML decision would not be unfairly penalised.\n\nAs a result of this 2024 decision by Federal Court, many homebuyers are expected to withdraw their LAD claims against the developers.\n\nHowever, it is pertinent to note that the AML ruling still stands and continues to uphold the intent of the statute to protect homebuyers.\n\nThe key takeaway from this latest development is the recognition of the need for a balanced approach that considers the interests of both homebuyers and developers.\n\nWhile protecting homebuyers remains a priority, the decision underscores the importance of fairness and clarity in legal processes by ensuring that all parties involved in real estate industry are treated justly. – July 26, 2024\n\n \n\nLeonard Yeoh is a partner, Chen Mei Yan an associate and Goh Jing Xuan with the law firm, Tay &amp; Partners.\n\n","author":"EnergyAnalyst","pubDate":"Sun, 28 Jul 2024 09:08:40 +0800"}

{"title":"Landmark Federal Court ruling re-defines rights of, Property buyers and developers","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5471876","description":"<a href='https://focusmalaysia.my/landmark-federal-court-ruling-re-defines-rights-of-property-developers-and-homebuyers/' target='_blank'>https://focusmalaysia.my/landmark-federal-c...and-homebuyers/</a>\n\nLandmark Federal Court ruling re-defines rights of property developers and homebuyers\nBy Leonard Yeoh, Chen Mei Yan &amp; Goh Jing Xuan\n\n\nTHE sale and purchase of property with housing developers are governed by the Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Regulations 1989 (HDR).\n\nThese regulations mandate that developers must deliver vacant possession within 24 months for landed properties and 36 months for high-rise properties.\n\nHowever, developers had the option to apply for an extension of time (EOT) to the Controller of Housing under Regulation 11(3) of the HDR in cases of special circumstances, hardship or when strict adherence to the contract of sale was impractical or unnecessary.\n\nIn November 2019, a landmark ruling changed the landscape of housing development in Malaysia.\n\nIn the case of Ang Ming Lee &amp; Ors v Menteri Kesejahteraan Bandar, Perumahan dan Kerajaan Tempatan &amp; Anor (AML), the Federal Court ruled that the interests of homebuyers should precede over developers.\n\nThe court declared that the controller’s power to grant EOTs under Regulation 11(3) was ultra vires which means that it exceeded legal authority.\n\nThis decision sent shockwaves through the industry, leaving many developers who had previously obtained EOTs potentially liable for liquidated ascertained damages (LAD) claims from homebuyers for delays caused by invalid EOTs.\n\n\n\nShrouded in confusion\n\nAt first, this ruling appeared to be a win for homebuyers. It compelled developers to adhere strictly to agreed timelines and provided homebuyers with the assurance of compensation in case of delays.\n\nThis protection was seen as a guard against unscrupulous and profit-oriented developers who might otherwise take advantage of the homebuyers.\n\nHowever, the decision had significant and unintended consequences. The AML ruling applied retrospectively, affecting developers who had secured EOTs before the AML ruling.\n\nThese developers had followed the law and the prescribed procedures to apply for EOTs and for many, had informed homebuyers about the EOTs during the signing of their sale and purchase agreements (SPA).\n\nConsequently, these developers faced lawsuits from homebuyers claiming LAD even when there was no delay since EOTs had been validly granted by the controller.\n\nThe confusion arose from the retrospective effect of the AML ruling. Retrospective rulings mean that a court’s decision applies to events or transactions that occurred even before the ruling was made.\n\nIf a court does not specify whether a ruling should apply prospectively (only to future cases) or retrospectively, the default position generally is retrospective.\n\nIn the AML case, the Federal Court did not clarify this, thus paving the way to a wave of legal challenges and uncertainty for developers.\n\nLandmark ruling\n\nThis legal uncertainty led to the case of Obata-Ambak Holdings Sdn Bhd v Prema Bonanza Sdn Bhd and two other appeals (Obata-Ambak). The developers in these cases appealed to the Federal Court, arguing among others, against the retrospectivity of the AML ruling.\n\nThe developers highlighted the deeply entrenched nature of Regulation 11(3) which had been the basis for the developers to obtain EOTs since 1989.\n\n\n\nToday (July 26), the five-member bench led by the Court of Appeal president Tan Sri Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim held that the AML ruling is to be applied prospectively in the interests of justice.\n\nUnanimously, the Federal Court held that the homebuyers cannot rely on the AML decision as a “carte blanche” to make financial gain against the developers who had at all times complied with the laws that were valid at that material time and obtained EOTs before the AML decision.\n\nThis decision provided relief and finality to developers who had acted in good faith under the previous understanding of the law and applied for EOTs due to genuine need.\n\nIt marked an important clarification by ensuring that developers who had obtained EOTs before the AML decision would not be unfairly penalised.\n\nAs a result of this 2024 decision by Federal Court, many homebuyers are expected to withdraw their LAD claims against the developers.\n\nHowever, it is pertinent to note that the AML ruling still stands and continues to uphold the intent of the statute to protect homebuyers.\n\nThe key takeaway from this latest development is the recognition of the need for a balanced approach that considers the interests of both homebuyers and developers.\n\nWhile protecting homebuyers remains a priority, the decision underscores the importance of fairness and clarity in legal processes by ensuring that all parties involved in real estate industry are treated justly. – July 26, 2024\n\n \n\nLeonard Yeoh is a partner, Chen Mei Yan an associate and Goh Jing Xuan with the law firm, Tay &amp; Partners.\n\n","author":"EnergyAnalyst","pubDate":"Sun, 28 Jul 2024 09:08:40 +0800"}

{"title":"Landmark Federal Court ruling re-defines rights of, Property buyers and developers","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5471876","description":"<a href='https://focusmalaysia.my/landmark-federal-court-ruling-re-defines-rights-of-property-developers-and-homebuyers/' target='_blank'>https://focusmalaysia.my/landmark-federal-c...and-homebuyers/</a>\n\nLandmark Federal Court ruling re-defines rights of property developers and homebuyers\nBy Leonard Yeoh, Chen Mei Yan &amp; Goh Jing Xuan\n\n\nTHE sale and purchase of property with housing developers are governed by the Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Regulations 1989 (HDR).\n\nThese regulations mandate that developers must deliver vacant possession within 24 months for landed properties and 36 months for high-rise properties.\n\nHowever, developers had the option to apply for an extension of time (EOT) to the Controller of Housing under Regulation 11(3) of the HDR in cases of special circumstances, hardship or when strict adherence to the contract of sale was impractical or unnecessary.\n\nIn November 2019, a landmark ruling changed the landscape of housing development in Malaysia.\n\nIn the case of Ang Ming Lee &amp; Ors v Menteri Kesejahteraan Bandar, Perumahan dan Kerajaan Tempatan &amp; Anor (AML), the Federal Court ruled that the interests of homebuyers should precede over developers.\n\nThe court declared that the controller’s power to grant EOTs under Regulation 11(3) was ultra vires which means that it exceeded legal authority.\n\nThis decision sent shockwaves through the industry, leaving many developers who had previously obtained EOTs potentially liable for liquidated ascertained damages (LAD) claims from homebuyers for delays caused by invalid EOTs.\n\n\n\nShrouded in confusion\n\nAt first, this ruling appeared to be a win for homebuyers. It compelled developers to adhere strictly to agreed timelines and provided homebuyers with the assurance of compensation in case of delays.\n\nThis protection was seen as a guard against unscrupulous and profit-oriented developers who might otherwise take advantage of the homebuyers.\n\nHowever, the decision had significant and unintended consequences. The AML ruling applied retrospectively, affecting developers who had secured EOTs before the AML ruling.\n\nThese developers had followed the law and the prescribed procedures to apply for EOTs and for many, had informed homebuyers about the EOTs during the signing of their sale and purchase agreements (SPA).\n\nConsequently, these developers faced lawsuits from homebuyers claiming LAD even when there was no delay since EOTs had been validly granted by the controller.\n\nThe confusion arose from the retrospective effect of the AML ruling. Retrospective rulings mean that a court’s decision applies to events or transactions that occurred even before the ruling was made.\n\nIf a court does not specify whether a ruling should apply prospectively (only to future cases) or retrospectively, the default position generally is retrospective.\n\nIn the AML case, the Federal Court did not clarify this, thus paving the way to a wave of legal challenges and uncertainty for developers.\n\nLandmark ruling\n\nThis legal uncertainty led to the case of Obata-Ambak Holdings Sdn Bhd v Prema Bonanza Sdn Bhd and two other appeals (Obata-Ambak). The developers in these cases appealed to the Federal Court, arguing among others, against the retrospectivity of the AML ruling.\n\nThe developers highlighted the deeply entrenched nature of Regulation 11(3) which had been the basis for the developers to obtain EOTs since 1989.\n\n\n\nToday (July 26), the five-member bench led by the Court of Appeal president Tan Sri Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim held that the AML ruling is to be applied prospectively in the interests of justice.\n\nUnanimously, the Federal Court held that the homebuyers cannot rely on the AML decision as a “carte blanche” to make financial gain against the developers who had at all times complied with the laws that were valid at that material time and obtained EOTs before the AML decision.\n\nThis decision provided relief and finality to developers who had acted in good faith under the previous understanding of the law and applied for EOTs due to genuine need.\n\nIt marked an important clarification by ensuring that developers who had obtained EOTs before the AML decision would not be unfairly penalised.\n\nAs a result of this 2024 decision by Federal Court, many homebuyers are expected to withdraw their LAD claims against the developers.\n\nHowever, it is pertinent to note that the AML ruling still stands and continues to uphold the intent of the statute to protect homebuyers.\n\nThe key takeaway from this latest development is the recognition of the need for a balanced approach that considers the interests of both homebuyers and developers.\n\nWhile protecting homebuyers remains a priority, the decision underscores the importance of fairness and clarity in legal processes by ensuring that all parties involved in real estate industry are treated justly. – July 26, 2024\n\n \n\nLeonard Yeoh is a partner, Chen Mei Yan an associate and Goh Jing Xuan with the law firm, Tay &amp; Partners.\n\n","author":"EnergyAnalyst","pubDate":"Sun, 28 Jul 2024 09:08:40 +0800"}

{"title":"Landmark Federal Court ruling re-defines rights of, Property buyers and developers","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5471876","description":"<a href='https://focusmalaysia.my/landmark-federal-court-ruling-re-defines-rights-of-property-developers-and-homebuyers/' target='_blank'>https://focusmalaysia.my/landmark-federal-c...and-homebuyers/</a>\n\nLandmark Federal Court ruling re-defines rights of property developers and homebuyers\nBy Leonard Yeoh, Chen Mei Yan &amp; Goh Jing Xuan\n\n\nTHE sale and purchase of property with housing developers are governed by the Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Regulations 1989 (HDR).\n\nThese regulations mandate that developers must deliver vacant possession within 24 months for landed properties and 36 months for high-rise properties.\n\nHowever, developers had the option to apply for an extension of time (EOT) to the Controller of Housing under Regulation 11(3) of the HDR in cases of special circumstances, hardship or when strict adherence to the contract of sale was impractical or unnecessary.\n\nIn November 2019, a landmark ruling changed the landscape of housing development in Malaysia.\n\nIn the case of Ang Ming Lee &amp; Ors v Menteri Kesejahteraan Bandar, Perumahan dan Kerajaan Tempatan &amp; Anor (AML), the Federal Court ruled that the interests of homebuyers should precede over developers.\n\nThe court declared that the controller’s power to grant EOTs under Regulation 11(3) was ultra vires which means that it exceeded legal authority.\n\nThis decision sent shockwaves through the industry, leaving many developers who had previously obtained EOTs potentially liable for liquidated ascertained damages (LAD) claims from homebuyers for delays caused by invalid EOTs.\n\n\n\nShrouded in confusion\n\nAt first, this ruling appeared to be a win for homebuyers. It compelled developers to adhere strictly to agreed timelines and provided homebuyers with the assurance of compensation in case of delays.\n\nThis protection was seen as a guard against unscrupulous and profit-oriented developers who might otherwise take advantage of the homebuyers.\n\nHowever, the decision had significant and unintended consequences. The AML ruling applied retrospectively, affecting developers who had secured EOTs before the AML ruling.\n\nThese developers had followed the law and the prescribed procedures to apply for EOTs and for many, had informed homebuyers about the EOTs during the signing of their sale and purchase agreements (SPA).\n\nConsequently, these developers faced lawsuits from homebuyers claiming LAD even when there was no delay since EOTs had been validly granted by the controller.\n\nThe confusion arose from the retrospective effect of the AML ruling. Retrospective rulings mean that a court’s decision applies to events or transactions that occurred even before the ruling was made.\n\nIf a court does not specify whether a ruling should apply prospectively (only to future cases) or retrospectively, the default position generally is retrospective.\n\nIn the AML case, the Federal Court did not clarify this, thus paving the way to a wave of legal challenges and uncertainty for developers.\n\nLandmark ruling\n\nThis legal uncertainty led to the case of Obata-Ambak Holdings Sdn Bhd v Prema Bonanza Sdn Bhd and two other appeals (Obata-Ambak). The developers in these cases appealed to the Federal Court, arguing among others, against the retrospectivity of the AML ruling.\n\nThe developers highlighted the deeply entrenched nature of Regulation 11(3) which had been the basis for the developers to obtain EOTs since 1989.\n\n\n\nToday (July 26), the five-member bench led by the Court of Appeal president Tan Sri Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim held that the AML ruling is to be applied prospectively in the interests of justice.\n\nUnanimously, the Federal Court held that the homebuyers cannot rely on the AML decision as a “carte blanche” to make financial gain against the developers who had at all times complied with the laws that were valid at that material time and obtained EOTs before the AML decision.\n\nThis decision provided relief and finality to developers who had acted in good faith under the previous understanding of the law and applied for EOTs due to genuine need.\n\nIt marked an important clarification by ensuring that developers who had obtained EOTs before the AML decision would not be unfairly penalised.\n\nAs a result of this 2024 decision by Federal Court, many homebuyers are expected to withdraw their LAD claims against the developers.\n\nHowever, it is pertinent to note that the AML ruling still stands and continues to uphold the intent of the statute to protect homebuyers.\n\nThe key takeaway from this latest development is the recognition of the need for a balanced approach that considers the interests of both homebuyers and developers.\n\nWhile protecting homebuyers remains a priority, the decision underscores the importance of fairness and clarity in legal processes by ensuring that all parties involved in real estate industry are treated justly. – July 26, 2024\n\n \n\nLeonard Yeoh is a partner, Chen Mei Yan an associate and Goh Jing Xuan with the law firm, Tay &amp; Partners.\n\n","author":"EnergyAnalyst","pubDate":"Sun, 28 Jul 2024 09:08:40 +0800"}

{"title":"Landmark Federal Court ruling re-defines rights of, Property buyers and developers","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5471876","description":"<a href='https://focusmalaysia.my/landmark-federal-court-ruling-re-defines-rights-of-property-developers-and-homebuyers/' target='_blank'>https://focusmalaysia.my/landmark-federal-c...and-homebuyers/</a>\n\nLandmark Federal Court ruling re-defines rights of property developers and homebuyers\nBy Leonard Yeoh, Chen Mei Yan &amp; Goh Jing Xuan\n\n\nTHE sale and purchase of property with housing developers are governed by the Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Regulations 1989 (HDR).\n\nThese regulations mandate that developers must deliver vacant possession within 24 months for landed properties and 36 months for high-rise properties.\n\nHowever, developers had the option to apply for an extension of time (EOT) to the Controller of Housing under Regulation 11(3) of the HDR in cases of special circumstances, hardship or when strict adherence to the contract of sale was impractical or unnecessary.\n\nIn November 2019, a landmark ruling changed the landscape of housing development in Malaysia.\n\nIn the case of Ang Ming Lee &amp; Ors v Menteri Kesejahteraan Bandar, Perumahan dan Kerajaan Tempatan &amp; Anor (AML), the Federal Court ruled that the interests of homebuyers should precede over developers.\n\nThe court declared that the controller’s power to grant EOTs under Regulation 11(3) was ultra vires which means that it exceeded legal authority.\n\nThis decision sent shockwaves through the industry, leaving many developers who had previously obtained EOTs potentially liable for liquidated ascertained damages (LAD) claims from homebuyers for delays caused by invalid EOTs.\n\n\n\nShrouded in confusion\n\nAt first, this ruling appeared to be a win for homebuyers. It compelled developers to adhere strictly to agreed timelines and provided homebuyers with the assurance of compensation in case of delays.\n\nThis protection was seen as a guard against unscrupulous and profit-oriented developers who might otherwise take advantage of the homebuyers.\n\nHowever, the decision had significant and unintended consequences. The AML ruling applied retrospectively, affecting developers who had secured EOTs before the AML ruling.\n\nThese developers had followed the law and the prescribed procedures to apply for EOTs and for many, had informed homebuyers about the EOTs during the signing of their sale and purchase agreements (SPA).\n\nConsequently, these developers faced lawsuits from homebuyers claiming LAD even when there was no delay since EOTs had been validly granted by the controller.\n\nThe confusion arose from the retrospective effect of the AML ruling. Retrospective rulings mean that a court’s decision applies to events or transactions that occurred even before the ruling was made.\n\nIf a court does not specify whether a ruling should apply prospectively (only to future cases) or retrospectively, the default position generally is retrospective.\n\nIn the AML case, the Federal Court did not clarify this, thus paving the way to a wave of legal challenges and uncertainty for developers.\n\nLandmark ruling\n\nThis legal uncertainty led to the case of Obata-Ambak Holdings Sdn Bhd v Prema Bonanza Sdn Bhd and two other appeals (Obata-Ambak). The developers in these cases appealed to the Federal Court, arguing among others, against the retrospectivity of the AML ruling.\n\nThe developers highlighted the deeply entrenched nature of Regulation 11(3) which had been the basis for the developers to obtain EOTs since 1989.\n\n\n\nToday (July 26), the five-member bench led by the Court of Appeal president Tan Sri Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim held that the AML ruling is to be applied prospectively in the interests of justice.\n\nUnanimously, the Federal Court held that the homebuyers cannot rely on the AML decision as a “carte blanche” to make financial gain against the developers who had at all times complied with the laws that were valid at that material time and obtained EOTs before the AML decision.\n\nThis decision provided relief and finality to developers who had acted in good faith under the previous understanding of the law and applied for EOTs due to genuine need.\n\nIt marked an important clarification by ensuring that developers who had obtained EOTs before the AML decision would not be unfairly penalised.\n\nAs a result of this 2024 decision by Federal Court, many homebuyers are expected to withdraw their LAD claims against the developers.\n\nHowever, it is pertinent to note that the AML ruling still stands and continues to uphold the intent of the statute to protect homebuyers.\n\nThe key takeaway from this latest development is the recognition of the need for a balanced approach that considers the interests of both homebuyers and developers.\n\nWhile protecting homebuyers remains a priority, the decision underscores the importance of fairness and clarity in legal processes by ensuring that all parties involved in real estate industry are treated justly. – July 26, 2024\n\n \n\nLeonard Yeoh is a partner, Chen Mei Yan an associate and Goh Jing Xuan with the law firm, Tay &amp; Partners.\n\n","author":"EnergyAnalyst","pubDate":"Sun, 28 Jul 2024 09:08:40 +0800"}

{"title":"Landmark Federal Court ruling re-defines rights of, Property buyers and developers","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5471876","description":"<a href='https://focusmalaysia.my/landmark-federal-court-ruling-re-defines-rights-of-property-developers-and-homebuyers/' target='_blank'>https://focusmalaysia.my/landmark-federal-c...and-homebuyers/</a>\n\nLandmark Federal Court ruling re-defines rights of property developers and homebuyers\nBy Leonard Yeoh, Chen Mei Yan &amp; Goh Jing Xuan\n\n\nTHE sale and purchase of property with housing developers are governed by the Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Regulations 1989 (HDR).\n\nThese regulations mandate that developers must deliver vacant possession within 24 months for landed properties and 36 months for high-rise properties.\n\nHowever, developers had the option to apply for an extension of time (EOT) to the Controller of Housing under Regulation 11(3) of the HDR in cases of special circumstances, hardship or when strict adherence to the contract of sale was impractical or unnecessary.\n\nIn November 2019, a landmark ruling changed the landscape of housing development in Malaysia.\n\nIn the case of Ang Ming Lee &amp; Ors v Menteri Kesejahteraan Bandar, Perumahan dan Kerajaan Tempatan &amp; Anor (AML), the Federal Court ruled that the interests of homebuyers should precede over developers.\n\nThe court declared that the controller’s power to grant EOTs under Regulation 11(3) was ultra vires which means that it exceeded legal authority.\n\nThis decision sent shockwaves through the industry, leaving many developers who had previously obtained EOTs potentially liable for liquidated ascertained damages (LAD) claims from homebuyers for delays caused by invalid EOTs.\n\n\n\nShrouded in confusion\n\nAt first, this ruling appeared to be a win for homebuyers. It compelled developers to adhere strictly to agreed timelines and provided homebuyers with the assurance of compensation in case of delays.\n\nThis protection was seen as a guard against unscrupulous and profit-oriented developers who might otherwise take advantage of the homebuyers.\n\nHowever, the decision had significant and unintended consequences. The AML ruling applied retrospectively, affecting developers who had secured EOTs before the AML ruling.\n\nThese developers had followed the law and the prescribed procedures to apply for EOTs and for many, had informed homebuyers about the EOTs during the signing of their sale and purchase agreements (SPA).\n\nConsequently, these developers faced lawsuits from homebuyers claiming LAD even when there was no delay since EOTs had been validly granted by the controller.\n\nThe confusion arose from the retrospective effect of the AML ruling. Retrospective rulings mean that a court’s decision applies to events or transactions that occurred even before the ruling was made.\n\nIf a court does not specify whether a ruling should apply prospectively (only to future cases) or retrospectively, the default position generally is retrospective.\n\nIn the AML case, the Federal Court did not clarify this, thus paving the way to a wave of legal challenges and uncertainty for developers.\n\nLandmark ruling\n\nThis legal uncertainty led to the case of Obata-Ambak Holdings Sdn Bhd v Prema Bonanza Sdn Bhd and two other appeals (Obata-Ambak). The developers in these cases appealed to the Federal Court, arguing among others, against the retrospectivity of the AML ruling.\n\nThe developers highlighted the deeply entrenched nature of Regulation 11(3) which had been the basis for the developers to obtain EOTs since 1989.\n\n\n\nToday (July 26), the five-member bench led by the Court of Appeal president Tan Sri Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim held that the AML ruling is to be applied prospectively in the interests of justice.\n\nUnanimously, the Federal Court held that the homebuyers cannot rely on the AML decision as a “carte blanche” to make financial gain against the developers who had at all times complied with the laws that were valid at that material time and obtained EOTs before the AML decision.\n\nThis decision provided relief and finality to developers who had acted in good faith under the previous understanding of the law and applied for EOTs due to genuine need.\n\nIt marked an important clarification by ensuring that developers who had obtained EOTs before the AML decision would not be unfairly penalised.\n\nAs a result of this 2024 decision by Federal Court, many homebuyers are expected to withdraw their LAD claims against the developers.\n\nHowever, it is pertinent to note that the AML ruling still stands and continues to uphold the intent of the statute to protect homebuyers.\n\nThe key takeaway from this latest development is the recognition of the need for a balanced approach that considers the interests of both homebuyers and developers.\n\nWhile protecting homebuyers remains a priority, the decision underscores the importance of fairness and clarity in legal processes by ensuring that all parties involved in real estate industry are treated justly. – July 26, 2024\n\n \n\nLeonard Yeoh is a partner, Chen Mei Yan an associate and Goh Jing Xuan with the law firm, Tay &amp; Partners.\n\n","author":"EnergyAnalyst","pubDate":"Sun, 28 Jul 2024 09:08:40 +0800"}

I said already got buyer viewing at my current price\n\nLater, I found out that the agent actually posted in mudah too, about 2 hours after my post, he posted same property with 20% lower than my price.\n\nHe still msg me whether I want to sell my current unit or not\n\nDoes it actually post with low price without any unit in hand just to attract buyer?","author":"Glcotan","pubDate":"Fri, 09 Aug 2024 09:27:07 +0800"}

{"title":"Landmark Federal Court ruling re-defines rights of, Property buyers and developers","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5471876","description":"<a href='https://focusmalaysia.my/landmark-federal-court-ruling-re-defines-rights-of-property-developers-and-homebuyers/' target='_blank'>https://focusmalaysia.my/landmark-federal-c...and-homebuyers/</a>\n\nLandmark Federal Court ruling re-defines rights of property developers and homebuyers\nBy Leonard Yeoh, Chen Mei Yan &amp; Goh Jing Xuan\n\n\nTHE sale and purchase of property with housing developers are governed by the Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Regulations 1989 (HDR).\n\nThese regulations mandate that developers must deliver vacant possession within 24 months for landed properties and 36 months for high-rise properties.\n\nHowever, developers had the option to apply for an extension of time (EOT) to the Controller of Housing under Regulation 11(3) of the HDR in cases of special circumstances, hardship or when strict adherence to the contract of sale was impractical or unnecessary.\n\nIn November 2019, a landmark ruling changed the landscape of housing development in Malaysia.\n\nIn the case of Ang Ming Lee &amp; Ors v Menteri Kesejahteraan Bandar, Perumahan dan Kerajaan Tempatan &amp; Anor (AML), the Federal Court ruled that the interests of homebuyers should precede over developers.\n\nThe court declared that the controller’s power to grant EOTs under Regulation 11(3) was ultra vires which means that it exceeded legal authority.\n\nThis decision sent shockwaves through the industry, leaving many developers who had previously obtained EOTs potentially liable for liquidated ascertained damages (LAD) claims from homebuyers for delays caused by invalid EOTs.\n\n\n\nShrouded in confusion\n\nAt first, this ruling appeared to be a win for homebuyers. It compelled developers to adhere strictly to agreed timelines and provided homebuyers with the assurance of compensation in case of delays.\n\nThis protection was seen as a guard against unscrupulous and profit-oriented developers who might otherwise take advantage of the homebuyers.\n\nHowever, the decision had significant and unintended consequences. The AML ruling applied retrospectively, affecting developers who had secured EOTs before the AML ruling.\n\nThese developers had followed the law and the prescribed procedures to apply for EOTs and for many, had informed homebuyers about the EOTs during the signing of their sale and purchase agreements (SPA).\n\nConsequently, these developers faced lawsuits from homebuyers claiming LAD even when there was no delay since EOTs had been validly granted by the controller.\n\nThe confusion arose from the retrospective effect of the AML ruling. Retrospective rulings mean that a court’s decision applies to events or transactions that occurred even before the ruling was made.\n\nIf a court does not specify whether a ruling should apply prospectively (only to future cases) or retrospectively, the default position generally is retrospective.\n\nIn the AML case, the Federal Court did not clarify this, thus paving the way to a wave of legal challenges and uncertainty for developers.\n\nLandmark ruling\n\nThis legal uncertainty led to the case of Obata-Ambak Holdings Sdn Bhd v Prema Bonanza Sdn Bhd and two other appeals (Obata-Ambak). The developers in these cases appealed to the Federal Court, arguing among others, against the retrospectivity of the AML ruling.\n\nThe developers highlighted the deeply entrenched nature of Regulation 11(3) which had been the basis for the developers to obtain EOTs since 1989.\n\n\n\nToday (July 26), the five-member bench led by the Court of Appeal president Tan Sri Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim held that the AML ruling is to be applied prospectively in the interests of justice.\n\nUnanimously, the Federal Court held that the homebuyers cannot rely on the AML decision as a “carte blanche” to make financial gain against the developers who had at all times complied with the laws that were valid at that material time and obtained EOTs before the AML decision.\n\nThis decision provided relief and finality to developers who had acted in good faith under the previous understanding of the law and applied for EOTs due to genuine need.\n\nIt marked an important clarification by ensuring that developers who had obtained EOTs before the AML decision would not be unfairly penalised.\n\nAs a result of this 2024 decision by Federal Court, many homebuyers are expected to withdraw their LAD claims against the developers.\n\nHowever, it is pertinent to note that the AML ruling still stands and continues to uphold the intent of the statute to protect homebuyers.\n\nThe key takeaway from this latest development is the recognition of the need for a balanced approach that considers the interests of both homebuyers and developers.\n\nWhile protecting homebuyers remains a priority, the decision underscores the importance of fairness and clarity in legal processes by ensuring that all parties involved in real estate industry are treated justly. – July 26, 2024\n\n \n\nLeonard Yeoh is a partner, Chen Mei Yan an associate and Goh Jing Xuan with the law firm, Tay &amp; Partners.\n\n","author":"EnergyAnalyst","pubDate":"Sun, 28 Jul 2024 09:08:40 +0800"}

{"title":"Experts warn of property investment risks, ","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5476991","description":"KUALA LUMPUR: Experts have warned property investors against trying to get ahead of the game in purchasing property near mega transport projects, citing risks of station cancellation or relocation that can impact property price value.\n\nFuture mega infrastructure projects can be a strong selling point for developers and property agents given that such projects tend to significantly increase the property value and rental rates around the projects.\n\nMalaysia has adopted the transit-oriented development (TOD) concept since 2001, starting with KL Sentral and expanded to Cyberjaya City Centre and PJ Sentral, among others.\n\nTOD is development centred on a rail or bus public transport station.\n\nProjects such as Mass Rapid Transit 3 (MRT3) and KL-Singapore high-speed rail (KL-SG HSR) instill a promise of connectivity are also creating the same pattern to the market value as seen in previous projects.\n\nThere are however significant risks to making property investments around these projects that may take several years to even get off the ground.\n\nIn fact, these projects also could be realigned or even cancelled at some point during the planning stage after considering the cost, technical challenges as well as public and political pressure.\n\nFor example, the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project was realigned two times involving the Section C route between Port Klang, Selangor and Mentakab, Pahang.\n\nThe first realignment in 2019 was rerouted through Negri Sembilan which shortened the total distance to 640km from 688km while the second change reverted the project to its original plan, making it 665km long now.\n\nAs for future projects like MRT3 Circle Line, the routes have been made public, but the alignments are not confirmed yet.\n\nThe government will decide on whether to proceed with the KL-SG HSR some time this year.\n\nTransport consultants said such infrastructure projects would take several years before the commencement of construction due to the process involved, alogn with other factors such as economic stability, political climate, and technical challenges.\n\nTransport consultant Wan Agyl Wan Hassan said the complexity of the journey from the announcement of a project to the start of construction involved four phases, including the feasibility studies and planning; approval process; tendering and contract award; and pre-construction activities.\n\nFor example, he said, the feasibility studies and planning usually takes one to two years, and the MRT3 project might take longer time due to the densely populated areas it will serve.\n\n&quot;Considering the lessons from MRT1 and MRT2, a more realistic expectation for MRT3&#39;s construction to begin might be within four to five years which accounts for potential delays, especially given the complexity and scale of the project,&quot; Wan Agyl told Business Times.\n\nThe MRT3 Circle Line will be connected to existing MRT, LRT, KTM, and Monorail lines through 10 interchange stations.  It will have 32 stations with 22 elevated stations, 7 underground stations and 3 elevated provisional stations.\n\nTransport consultant Rosli Khan said the current stations of the MRT3 alignment could change in the future, factoring in the need to adjust station locations to better serve changing population centres or commercial hubs.\n\nFurthermore, he said feedback from the public or shifts in commuting patterns could lead to adjustments to better meet the needs of the users, especially for deprived areas where certain communities are trapped by overbuilt tolled highways.\n\nRosli said innovations in construction or transit technology might enable more efficient station placements or designs that were not feasible during the original planning.\n\nHaving said that, he said that realignment comes with several potential impacts, especially station accessibility where the previous MRT projects have received backlash.\n\n&quot;Significant criticism has been voiced in the past with regards to poor access for MRT1 and MRT2 where some stations are placed next to highways and passenger&#39;s accessibility are much restricted while safety concerns become major issues.&quot;This requires new oversight and tight rounds of regulatory approvals, which are notably absence at the moment,&quot; he said.\n\nProperty overhang reducing TODs around MRT 3?\n\nTransport business consultant YS Chan said there are fewer TODs planned around MRT 3 than the other two MRTs before, given that 50 per cent of the property overhang in the Klang Valley area are for those above RM500,000.\n\n&quot;There is an oversupply of residential and office properties in the Klang Valley, with an overhang of 50 per cent for those valued at RM500,000 and above, which is within the price range of TOD developments.&quot;\n\n&quot;The MRT3 is just to complete the rail network in the Klang Valley and can proceed if funds are available. But like most existing office space and luxury condos, the return on investments (ROI) for both MRT3 and its transit-oriented developments (TODs) will be low,&quot; he added.\n\nChan expects lower ridership for MRT3 and lower number of developments around the stations as COVID-19 have changed the way people work, coupled with large corporation&#39;s lower appetite to invest in office buildings.\n\nAccording to him, large corporations are no longer interested investing in huge office buildings, which are more of a liability and no longer seen as prestigious. Chan said the TOD around MRT1 stations saw an equal share of successes and failures.\n\nHe said that while the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail project has not started yet, developers have approached TODs at MRT2 stations with extreme caution.\n\nWhile the MRT3 project is considered good as a proactive future investment, Rosli warned that overspending on projects in Klang Valley may increase the imbalance in development, suggesting that the funds for MRT3 should be spent in other regions in Malaysia.\n\n&quot;Consideration should be given to review budget allocation for MRT3, to be better spent on the provision of public transport in many other urban areas such as Kota Kinabalu, Johor Bharu, Melaka, Kuantan, Kuala Terengganu and Kota Bharu,&quot; he said.\n\n<a href='https://www.nst.com.my/business/economy/2024/08/1093395/transport-projects-experts-warn-property-investment-risks' target='_blank'>https://www.nst.com.my/business/economy/202...nvestment-risks</a>","author":"Jazted","pubDate":"Mon, 19 Aug 2024 21:26:50 +0800"}

OMG, such a\n\nbig Scam, to avoid this situation here come for some Tip for those who really want buy Property Invest or Own Stay to check their property real value\n\n\n<b>Rental Rate Calculation</b>\nSo my advice is dont buy over Price Property. how to justify the value of Property, i give u 1 Formula\n\nAnnual Rental / ROI 6% = Property Value\n\nRM 24000 / 6% = 400k (If you bought 400k Property u must rent out RM 2000 per month, otherwise u will suffer lose for u Investment)\n\n\n<b>Occupancy Rate</b>\nKindly Check the number of Property being Advertisement for Rent Out, if the Advertisement More than 70 Advertisement that mean u property not easy to rent out, we only look for below 70 Advertisement Property to Rent out\n\n<a href='https://pictr.com/image/xa5Rvq' target='_blank'><img src='https://pictr.com/images/2024/08/16/xa5Rvq.md.png' border='0' alt='user posted image' /></a>\n<a href='https://pictr.com/image/xa5t7I' target='_blank'><img src='https://pictr.com/images/2024/08/16/xa5t7I.md.png' border='0' alt='user posted image' /></a>\n\n<b>Development for the area</b>\nKindly Look for the Google Map, Make sure Surrounding area not much Empty Land, because New Condo build up will affect the Rental Yield Drop, normally we will check within 5km the empty land. another is check for within 5km how many Office Building , University or College, Shopping Mall have, because this 3 type Commercial will Increase the Rental Rate and Occupancy Rate\n\n<b>Accessbility</b>\nPlease Make sure buying Property Nearest MRT, LRT and BRT, more nearest more better, if have cover walkway then is Perfect. because Nowadays Klang Valley Traffice very Jam, for those worker office near MRT and LRT, they will prefer take Public Transport going to Work. What i said near is walking distant within 5 to 7 minute, u need to try youself walk from the Condo to the MRT and LRT, if more than 7 minute not consider NEAR... if need to Across the Road, i suggest dont buy, because Across the Road to reach MRT, LRT is Dangerous, not Tenant would like to take this Risky Walkway.\n\nCONCLUSION: DONT TRUST THE PROPERTY AGENT TALK TO YOU EVERY SINGLE WORD, THEY ONLY WANT TO EARN MONEY AND SELL OFF THE PROPERTY, U ONLY ASK THEM THE LOCATION, PRICE AND SIZE. ALL THE RESEARCH NEED TO DONE BY YOU, BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ONE TO TAKING LOAN 35 YEARS NOT PROPERTY AGENT.\n\nNOT WORRY NEW LAUNCH PROJECT SELLING FAST, THOSE SAID SELLING FAST PROJECT ACTUALLY IS THE DEVELOPER MAKE A STORY, EVEN THE PROJECT ALL SOLD OUT, BELIEVE ME, U JUST GO FOR WAITING LIST, CONFIRM HAVE AVAILABLE UNIT... \n\nWISH EVERYONE INVEST IN PROPERTY WITH CLEAR MIND AND RIGHT DECISION. </span>\n\n","author":"thx2012","pubDate":"Fri, 16 Aug 2024 15:12:51 +0800"}

We have about 250 acres of land remaining there,” he says.\n\nHe adds that BRDB has been involved in many aspects of developing the township, including conceptualisation of design, design development, selection of architects and consultants, project implementation as well as marketing.\n\nBandar Baru Permas Jaya comprises residential, commercial and industrial developments as well as public infrastructure. Christopher says the township’s location, which is to the east of Johor Baru, and its property offerings are its most unique features.\n\n“It takes about five to 10 minutes to drive to Johor Baru [city centre] if the traffic is clear. \n\n<span style='font-size:16pt;line-height:100%'>The game changer was when we completed the Permas Jaya Bridge in 1994</span>, which crosses the Tebrau and Plentong rivers. It was built to shorten the travel distance between Bandar Baru Permas Jaya and the Johor Baru city area, from about 18km to 6km,” he adds.\n\n“Then we started the construction of the Second Permas Jaya Bridge in 2008, which was proposed under the Iskandar Malaysia development plan. The bridge was completed and opened to the public in 2012 to provide a direct connection to the Johor Bahru East Coast Highway.”\n\n\n<img src='https://i.ibb.co/G5njHxJ/kwsp.jpg' border='0' alt='user posted image' />\n\n36, 40, Jalan Permas 15/1, \nBandar Baru Permas Jaya, \n81750 Masai\n\n\n<img src='https://i.ibb.co/K66cS5p/permas-mall.jpg' border='0' alt='user posted image' />\n\n\n9 BANK\n\n\n\nMAYBANK\n\n G-01, 01-01 &amp; 02-01, Block A, \nPermas Mall \n3,Jalan Permas Utara, \nBandar Baru Permas Jaya,\n81750 Masai\n\n\n\n\nThe township is also accessible via the Eastern Dispersal Link (EDL) and linked to the North-South Expressway, Pasir Gudang Highway and the Johor-Singapore Causeway, which is about 10km away.\n\nMAZDA\nAZAM MOTOR SERVICES SDN.

{"title":"Experts warn of property investment risks, ","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5476991","description":"KUALA LUMPUR: Experts have warned property investors against trying to get ahead of the game in purchasing property near mega transport projects, citing risks of station cancellation or relocation that can impact property price value.\n\nFuture mega infrastructure projects can be a strong selling point for developers and property agents given that such projects tend to significantly increase the property value and rental rates around the projects.\n\nMalaysia has adopted the transit-oriented development (TOD) concept since 2001, starting with KL Sentral and expanded to Cyberjaya City Centre and PJ Sentral, among others.\n\nTOD is development centred on a rail or bus public transport station.\n\nProjects such as Mass Rapid Transit 3 (MRT3) and KL-Singapore high-speed rail (KL-SG HSR) instill a promise of connectivity are also creating the same pattern to the market value as seen in previous projects.\n\nThere are however significant risks to making property investments around these projects that may take several years to even get off the ground.\n\nIn fact, these projects also could be realigned or even cancelled at some point during the planning stage after considering the cost, technical challenges as well as public and political pressure.\n\nFor example, the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project was realigned two times involving the Section C route between Port Klang, Selangor and Mentakab, Pahang.\n\nThe first realignment in 2019 was rerouted through Negri Sembilan which shortened the total distance to 640km from 688km while the second change reverted the project to its original plan, making it 665km long now.\n\nAs for future projects like MRT3 Circle Line, the routes have been made public, but the alignments are not confirmed yet.\n\nThe government will decide on whether to proceed with the KL-SG HSR some time this year.\n\nTransport consultants said such infrastructure projects would take several years before the commencement of construction due to the process involved, alogn with other factors such as economic stability, political climate, and technical challenges.\n\nTransport consultant Wan Agyl Wan Hassan said the complexity of the journey from the announcement of a project to the start of construction involved four phases, including the feasibility studies and planning; approval process; tendering and contract award; and pre-construction activities.\n\nFor example, he said, the feasibility studies and planning usually takes one to two years, and the MRT3 project might take longer time due to the densely populated areas it will serve.\n\n&quot;Considering the lessons from MRT1 and MRT2, a more realistic expectation for MRT3&#39;s construction to begin might be within four to five years which accounts for potential delays, especially given the complexity and scale of the project,&quot; Wan Agyl told Business Times.\n\nThe MRT3 Circle Line will be connected to existing MRT, LRT, KTM, and Monorail lines through 10 interchange stations.  It will have 32 stations with 22 elevated stations, 7 underground stations and 3 elevated provisional stations.\n\nTransport consultant Rosli Khan said the current stations of the MRT3 alignment could change in the future, factoring in the need to adjust station locations to better serve changing population centres or commercial hubs.\n\nFurthermore, he said feedback from the public or shifts in commuting patterns could lead to adjustments to better meet the needs of the users, especially for deprived areas where certain communities are trapped by overbuilt tolled highways.\n\nRosli said innovations in construction or transit technology might enable more efficient station placements or designs that were not feasible during the original planning.\n\nHaving said that, he said that realignment comes with several potential impacts, especially station accessibility where the previous MRT projects have received backlash.\n\n&quot;Significant criticism has been voiced in the past with regards to poor access for MRT1 and MRT2 where some stations are placed next to highways and passenger&#39;s accessibility are much restricted while safety concerns become major issues.&quot;This requires new oversight and tight rounds of regulatory approvals, which are notably absence at the moment,&quot; he said.\n\nProperty overhang reducing TODs around MRT 3?\n\nTransport business consultant YS Chan said there are fewer TODs planned around MRT 3 than the other two MRTs before, given that 50 per cent of the property overhang in the Klang Valley area are for those above RM500,000.\n\n&quot;There is an oversupply of residential and office properties in the Klang Valley, with an overhang of 50 per cent for those valued at RM500,000 and above, which is within the price range of TOD developments.&quot;\n\n&quot;The MRT3 is just to complete the rail network in the Klang Valley and can proceed if funds are available. But like most existing office space and luxury condos, the return on investments (ROI) for both MRT3 and its transit-oriented developments (TODs) will be low,&quot; he added.\n\nChan expects lower ridership for MRT3 and lower number of developments around the stations as COVID-19 have changed the way people work, coupled with large corporation&#39;s lower appetite to invest in office buildings.\n\nAccording to him, large corporations are no longer interested investing in huge office buildings, which are more of a liability and no longer seen as prestigious. Chan said the TOD around MRT1 stations saw an equal share of successes and failures.\n\nHe said that while the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail project has not started yet, developers have approached TODs at MRT2 stations with extreme caution.\n\nWhile the MRT3 project is considered good as a proactive future investment, Rosli warned that overspending on projects in Klang Valley may increase the imbalance in development, suggesting that the funds for MRT3 should be spent in other regions in Malaysia.\n\n&quot;Consideration should be given to review budget allocation for MRT3, to be better spent on the provision of public transport in many other urban areas such as Kota Kinabalu, Johor Bharu, Melaka, Kuantan, Kuala Terengganu and Kota Bharu,&quot; he said.\n\n<a href='https://www.nst.com.my/business/economy/2024/08/1093395/transport-projects-experts-warn-property-investment-risks' target='_blank'>https://www.nst.com.my/business/economy/202...nvestment-risks</a>","author":"Jazted","pubDate":"Mon, 19 Aug 2024 21:26:50 +0800"}

{"title":"Experts warn of property investment risks, ","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5476991","description":"KUALA LUMPUR: Experts have warned property investors against trying to get ahead of the game in purchasing property near mega transport projects, citing risks of station cancellation or relocation that can impact property price value.\n\nFuture mega infrastructure projects can be a strong selling point for developers and property agents given that such projects tend to significantly increase the property value and rental rates around the projects.\n\nMalaysia has adopted the transit-oriented development (TOD) concept since 2001, starting with KL Sentral and expanded to Cyberjaya City Centre and PJ Sentral, among others.\n\nTOD is development centred on a rail or bus public transport station.\n\nProjects such as Mass Rapid Transit 3 (MRT3) and KL-Singapore high-speed rail (KL-SG HSR) instill a promise of connectivity are also creating the same pattern to the market value as seen in previous projects.\n\nThere are however significant risks to making property investments around these projects that may take several years to even get off the ground.\n\nIn fact, these projects also could be realigned or even cancelled at some point during the planning stage after considering the cost, technical challenges as well as public and political pressure.\n\nFor example, the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project was realigned two times involving the Section C route between Port Klang, Selangor and Mentakab, Pahang.\n\nThe first realignment in 2019 was rerouted through Negri Sembilan which shortened the total distance to 640km from 688km while the second change reverted the project to its original plan, making it 665km long now.\n\nAs for future projects like MRT3 Circle Line, the routes have been made public, but the alignments are not confirmed yet.\n\nThe government will decide on whether to proceed with the KL-SG HSR some time this year.\n\nTransport consultants said such infrastructure projects would take several years before the commencement of construction due to the process involved, alogn with other factors such as economic stability, political climate, and technical challenges.\n\nTransport consultant Wan Agyl Wan Hassan said the complexity of the journey from the announcement of a project to the start of construction involved four phases, including the feasibility studies and planning; approval process; tendering and contract award; and pre-construction activities.\n\nFor example, he said, the feasibility studies and planning usually takes one to two years, and the MRT3 project might take longer time due to the densely populated areas it will serve.\n\n&quot;Considering the lessons from MRT1 and MRT2, a more realistic expectation for MRT3&#39;s construction to begin might be within four to five years which accounts for potential delays, especially given the complexity and scale of the project,&quot; Wan Agyl told Business Times.\n\nThe MRT3 Circle Line will be connected to existing MRT, LRT, KTM, and Monorail lines through 10 interchange stations.  It will have 32 stations with 22 elevated stations, 7 underground stations and 3 elevated provisional stations.\n\nTransport consultant Rosli Khan said the current stations of the MRT3 alignment could change in the future, factoring in the need to adjust station locations to better serve changing population centres or commercial hubs.\n\nFurthermore, he said feedback from the public or shifts in commuting patterns could lead to adjustments to better meet the needs of the users, especially for deprived areas where certain communities are trapped by overbuilt tolled highways.\n\nRosli said innovations in construction or transit technology might enable more efficient station placements or designs that were not feasible during the original planning.\n\nHaving said that, he said that realignment comes with several potential impacts, especially station accessibility where the previous MRT projects have received backlash.\n\n&quot;Significant criticism has been voiced in the past with regards to poor access for MRT1 and MRT2 where some stations are placed next to highways and passenger&#39;s accessibility are much restricted while safety concerns become major issues.&quot;This requires new oversight and tight rounds of regulatory approvals, which are notably absence at the moment,&quot; he said.\n\nProperty overhang reducing TODs around MRT 3?\n\nTransport business consultant YS Chan said there are fewer TODs planned around MRT 3 than the other two MRTs before, given that 50 per cent of the property overhang in the Klang Valley area are for those above RM500,000.\n\n&quot;There is an oversupply of residential and office properties in the Klang Valley, with an overhang of 50 per cent for those valued at RM500,000 and above, which is within the price range of TOD developments.&quot;\n\n&quot;The MRT3 is just to complete the rail network in the Klang Valley and can proceed if funds are available. But like most existing office space and luxury condos, the return on investments (ROI) for both MRT3 and its transit-oriented developments (TODs) will be low,&quot; he added.\n\nChan expects lower ridership for MRT3 and lower number of developments around the stations as COVID-19 have changed the way people work, coupled with large corporation&#39;s lower appetite to invest in office buildings.\n\nAccording to him, large corporations are no longer interested investing in huge office buildings, which are more of a liability and no longer seen as prestigious. Chan said the TOD around MRT1 stations saw an equal share of successes and failures.\n\nHe said that while the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail project has not started yet, developers have approached TODs at MRT2 stations with extreme caution.\n\nWhile the MRT3 project is considered good as a proactive future investment, Rosli warned that overspending on projects in Klang Valley may increase the imbalance in development, suggesting that the funds for MRT3 should be spent in other regions in Malaysia.\n\n&quot;Consideration should be given to review budget allocation for MRT3, to be better spent on the provision of public transport in many other urban areas such as Kota Kinabalu, Johor Bharu, Melaka, Kuantan, Kuala Terengganu and Kota Bharu,&quot; he said.\n\n<a href='https://www.nst.com.my/business/economy/2024/08/1093395/transport-projects-experts-warn-property-investment-risks' target='_blank'>https://www.nst.com.my/business/economy/202...nvestment-risks</a>","author":"Jazted","pubDate":"Mon, 19 Aug 2024 21:26:50 +0800"}

OMG, such a\n\nbig Scam, to avoid this situation here come for some Tip for those who really want buy Property Invest or Own Stay to check their property real value\n\n\n<b>Rental Rate Calculation</b>\nSo my advice is dont buy over Price Property. how to justify the value of Property, i give u 1 Formula\n\nAnnual Rental / ROI 6% = Property Value\n\nRM 24000 / 6% = 400k (If you bought 400k Property u must rent out RM 2000 per month, otherwise u will suffer lose for u Investment)\n\n\n<b>Occupancy Rate</b>\nKindly Check the number of Property being Advertisement for Rent Out, if the Advertisement More than 70 Advertisement that mean u property not easy to rent out, we only look for below 70 Advertisement Property to Rent out\n\n<a href='https://pictr.com/image/xa5Rvq' target='_blank'><img src='https://pictr.com/images/2024/08/16/xa5Rvq.md.png' border='0' alt='user posted image' /></a>\n<a href='https://pictr.com/image/xa5t7I' target='_blank'><img src='https://pictr.com/images/2024/08/16/xa5t7I.md.png' border='0' alt='user posted image' /></a>\n\n<b>Development for the area</b>\nKindly Look for the Google Map, Make sure Surrounding area not much Empty Land, because New Condo build up will affect the Rental Yield Drop, normally we will check within 5km the empty land. another is check for within 5km how many Office Building , University or College, Shopping Mall have, because this 3 type Commercial will Increase the Rental Rate and Occupancy Rate\n\n<b>Accessbility</b>\nPlease Make sure buying Property Nearest MRT, LRT and BRT, more nearest more better, if have cover walkway then is Perfect. because Nowadays Klang Valley Traffice very Jam, for those worker office near MRT and LRT, they will prefer take Public Transport going to Work. What i said near is walking distant within 5 to 7 minute, u need to try youself walk from the Condo to the MRT and LRT, if more than 7 minute not consider NEAR... if need to Across the Road, i suggest dont buy, because Across the Road to reach MRT, LRT is Dangerous, not Tenant would like to take this Risky Walkway.\n\nCONCLUSION: DONT TRUST THE PROPERTY AGENT TALK TO YOU EVERY SINGLE WORD, THEY ONLY WANT TO EARN MONEY AND SELL OFF THE PROPERTY, U ONLY ASK THEM THE LOCATION, PRICE AND SIZE. ALL THE RESEARCH NEED TO DONE BY YOU, BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ONE TO TAKING LOAN 35 YEARS NOT PROPERTY AGENT.\n\nNOT WORRY NEW LAUNCH PROJECT SELLING FAST, THOSE SAID SELLING FAST PROJECT ACTUALLY IS THE DEVELOPER MAKE A STORY, EVEN THE PROJECT ALL SOLD OUT, BELIEVE ME, U JUST GO FOR WAITING LIST, CONFIRM HAVE AVAILABLE UNIT... \n\nWISH EVERYONE INVEST IN PROPERTY WITH CLEAR MIND AND RIGHT DECISION. </span>\n\n","author":"thx2012","pubDate":"Fri, 16 Aug 2024 15:12:51 +0800"}

{"title":"Experts warn of property investment risks, ","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5476991","description":"KUALA LUMPUR: Experts have warned property investors against trying to get ahead of the game in purchasing property near mega transport projects, citing risks of station cancellation or relocation that can impact property price value.\n\nFuture mega infrastructure projects can be a strong selling point for developers and property agents given that such projects tend to significantly increase the property value and rental rates around the projects.\n\nMalaysia has adopted the transit-oriented development (TOD) concept since 2001, starting with KL Sentral and expanded to Cyberjaya City Centre and PJ Sentral, among others.\n\nTOD is development centred on a rail or bus public transport station.\n\nProjects such as Mass Rapid Transit 3 (MRT3) and KL-Singapore high-speed rail (KL-SG HSR) instill a promise of connectivity are also creating the same pattern to the market value as seen in previous projects.\n\nThere are however significant risks to making property investments around these projects that may take several years to even get off the ground.\n\nIn fact, these projects also could be realigned or even cancelled at some point during the planning stage after considering the cost, technical challenges as well as public and political pressure.\n\nFor example, the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project was realigned two times involving the Section C route between Port Klang, Selangor and Mentakab, Pahang.\n\nThe first realignment in 2019 was rerouted through Negri Sembilan which shortened the total distance to 640km from 688km while the second change reverted the project to its original plan, making it 665km long now.\n\nAs for future projects like MRT3 Circle Line, the routes have been made public, but the alignments are not confirmed yet.\n\nThe government will decide on whether to proceed with the KL-SG HSR some time this year.\n\nTransport consultants said such infrastructure projects would take several years before the commencement of construction due to the process involved, alogn with other factors such as economic stability, political climate, and technical challenges.\n\nTransport consultant Wan Agyl Wan Hassan said the complexity of the journey from the announcement of a project to the start of construction involved four phases, including the feasibility studies and planning; approval process; tendering and contract award; and pre-construction activities.\n\nFor example, he said, the feasibility studies and planning usually takes one to two years, and the MRT3 project might take longer time due to the densely populated areas it will serve.\n\n&quot;Considering the lessons from MRT1 and MRT2, a more realistic expectation for MRT3&#39;s construction to begin might be within four to five years which accounts for potential delays, especially given the complexity and scale of the project,&quot; Wan Agyl told Business Times.\n\nThe MRT3 Circle Line will be connected to existing MRT, LRT, KTM, and Monorail lines through 10 interchange stations.  It will have 32 stations with 22 elevated stations, 7 underground stations and 3 elevated provisional stations.\n\nTransport consultant Rosli Khan said the current stations of the MRT3 alignment could change in the future, factoring in the need to adjust station locations to better serve changing population centres or commercial hubs.\n\nFurthermore, he said feedback from the public or shifts in commuting patterns could lead to adjustments to better meet the needs of the users, especially for deprived areas where certain communities are trapped by overbuilt tolled highways.\n\nRosli said innovations in construction or transit technology might enable more efficient station placements or designs that were not feasible during the original planning.\n\nHaving said that, he said that realignment comes with several potential impacts, especially station accessibility where the previous MRT projects have received backlash.\n\n&quot;Significant criticism has been voiced in the past with regards to poor access for MRT1 and MRT2 where some stations are placed next to highways and passenger&#39;s accessibility are much restricted while safety concerns become major issues.&quot;This requires new oversight and tight rounds of regulatory approvals, which are notably absence at the moment,&quot; he said.\n\nProperty overhang reducing TODs around MRT 3?\n\nTransport business consultant YS Chan said there are fewer TODs planned around MRT 3 than the other two MRTs before, given that 50 per cent of the property overhang in the Klang Valley area are for those above RM500,000.\n\n&quot;There is an oversupply of residential and office properties in the Klang Valley, with an overhang of 50 per cent for those valued at RM500,000 and above, which is within the price range of TOD developments.&quot;\n\n&quot;The MRT3 is just to complete the rail network in the Klang Valley and can proceed if funds are available. But like most existing office space and luxury condos, the return on investments (ROI) for both MRT3 and its transit-oriented developments (TODs) will be low,&quot; he added.\n\nChan expects lower ridership for MRT3 and lower number of developments around the stations as COVID-19 have changed the way people work, coupled with large corporation&#39;s lower appetite to invest in office buildings.\n\nAccording to him, large corporations are no longer interested investing in huge office buildings, which are more of a liability and no longer seen as prestigious. Chan said the TOD around MRT1 stations saw an equal share of successes and failures.\n\nHe said that while the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail project has not started yet, developers have approached TODs at MRT2 stations with extreme caution.\n\nWhile the MRT3 project is considered good as a proactive future investment, Rosli warned that overspending on projects in Klang Valley may increase the imbalance in development, suggesting that the funds for MRT3 should be spent in other regions in Malaysia.\n\n&quot;Consideration should be given to review budget allocation for MRT3, to be better spent on the provision of public transport in many other urban areas such as Kota Kinabalu, Johor Bharu, Melaka, Kuantan, Kuala Terengganu and Kota Bharu,&quot; he said.\n\n<a href='https://www.nst.com.my/business/economy/2024/08/1093395/transport-projects-experts-warn-property-investment-risks' target='_blank'>https://www.nst.com.my/business/economy/202...nvestment-risks</a>","author":"Jazted","pubDate":"Mon, 19 Aug 2024 21:26:50 +0800"}

OMG, such a\n\nbig Scam, to avoid this situation here come for some Tip for those who really want buy Property Invest or Own Stay to check their property real value\n\n\n<b>Rental Rate Calculation</b>\nSo my advice is dont buy over Price Property. how to justify the value of Property, i give u 1 Formula\n\nAnnual Rental / ROI 6% = Property Value\n\nRM 24000 / 6% = 400k (If you bought 400k Property u must rent out RM 2000 per month, otherwise u will suffer lose for u Investment)\n\n\n<b>Occupancy Rate</b>\nKindly Check the number of Property being Advertisement for Rent Out, if the Advertisement More than 70 Advertisement that mean u property not easy to rent out, we only look for below 70 Advertisement Property to Rent out\n\n<a href='https://pictr.com/image/xa5Rvq' target='_blank'><img src='https://pictr.com/images/2024/08/16/xa5Rvq.md.png' border='0' alt='user posted image' /></a>\n<a href='https://pictr.com/image/xa5t7I' target='_blank'><img src='https://pictr.com/images/2024/08/16/xa5t7I.md.png' border='0' alt='user posted image' /></a>\n\n<b>Development for the area</b>\nKindly Look for the Google Map, Make sure Surrounding area not much Empty Land, because New Condo build up will affect the Rental Yield Drop, normally we will check within 5km the empty land. another is check for within 5km how many Office Building , University or College, Shopping Mall have, because this 3 type Commercial will Increase the Rental Rate and Occupancy Rate\n\n<b>Accessbility</b>\nPlease Make sure buying Property Nearest MRT, LRT and BRT, more nearest more better, if have cover walkway then is Perfect. because Nowadays Klang Valley Traffice very Jam, for those worker office near MRT and LRT, they will prefer take Public Transport going to Work. What i said near is walking distant within 5 to 7 minute, u need to try youself walk from the Condo to the MRT and LRT, if more than 7 minute not consider NEAR... if need to Across the Road, i suggest dont buy, because Across the Road to reach MRT, LRT is Dangerous, not Tenant would like to take this Risky Walkway.\n\nCONCLUSION: DONT TRUST THE PROPERTY AGENT TALK TO YOU EVERY SINGLE WORD, THEY ONLY WANT TO EARN MONEY AND SELL OFF THE PROPERTY, U ONLY ASK THEM THE LOCATION, PRICE AND SIZE. ALL THE RESEARCH NEED TO DONE BY YOU, BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ONE TO TAKING LOAN 35 YEARS NOT PROPERTY AGENT.\n\nNOT WORRY NEW LAUNCH PROJECT SELLING FAST, THOSE SAID SELLING FAST PROJECT ACTUALLY IS THE DEVELOPER MAKE A STORY, EVEN THE PROJECT ALL SOLD OUT, BELIEVE ME, U JUST GO FOR WAITING LIST, CONFIRM HAVE AVAILABLE UNIT... \n\nWISH EVERYONE INVEST IN PROPERTY WITH CLEAR MIND AND RIGHT DECISION. </span>\n\n","author":"thx2012","pubDate":"Fri, 16 Aug 2024 15:12:51 +0800"}

{"title":"Experts warn of property investment risks, ","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5476991","description":"KUALA LUMPUR: Experts have warned property investors against trying to get ahead of the game in purchasing property near mega transport projects, citing risks of station cancellation or relocation that can impact property price value.\n\nFuture mega infrastructure projects can be a strong selling point for developers and property agents given that such projects tend to significantly increase the property value and rental rates around the projects.\n\nMalaysia has adopted the transit-oriented development (TOD) concept since 2001, starting with KL Sentral and expanded to Cyberjaya City Centre and PJ Sentral, among others.\n\nTOD is development centred on a rail or bus public transport station.\n\nProjects such as Mass Rapid Transit 3 (MRT3) and KL-Singapore high-speed rail (KL-SG HSR) instill a promise of connectivity are also creating the same pattern to the market value as seen in previous projects.\n\nThere are however significant risks to making property investments around these projects that may take several years to even get off the ground.\n\nIn fact, these projects also could be realigned or even cancelled at some point during the planning stage after considering the cost, technical challenges as well as public and political pressure.\n\nFor example, the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project was realigned two times involving the Section C route between Port Klang, Selangor and Mentakab, Pahang.\n\nThe first realignment in 2019 was rerouted through Negri Sembilan which shortened the total distance to 640km from 688km while the second change reverted the project to its original plan, making it 665km long now.\n\nAs for future projects like MRT3 Circle Line, the routes have been made public, but the alignments are not confirmed yet.\n\nThe government will decide on whether to proceed with the KL-SG HSR some time this year.\n\nTransport consultants said such infrastructure projects would take several years before the commencement of construction due to the process involved, alogn with other factors such as economic stability, political climate, and technical challenges.\n\nTransport consultant Wan Agyl Wan Hassan said the complexity of the journey from the announcement of a project to the start of construction involved four phases, including the feasibility studies and planning; approval process; tendering and contract award; and pre-construction activities.\n\nFor example, he said, the feasibility studies and planning usually takes one to two years, and the MRT3 project might take longer time due to the densely populated areas it will serve.\n\n&quot;Considering the lessons from MRT1 and MRT2, a more realistic expectation for MRT3&#39;s construction to begin might be within four to five years which accounts for potential delays, especially given the complexity and scale of the project,&quot; Wan Agyl told Business Times.\n\nThe MRT3 Circle Line will be connected to existing MRT, LRT, KTM, and Monorail lines through 10 interchange stations.  It will have 32 stations with 22 elevated stations, 7 underground stations and 3 elevated provisional stations.\n\nTransport consultant Rosli Khan said the current stations of the MRT3 alignment could change in the future, factoring in the need to adjust station locations to better serve changing population centres or commercial hubs.\n\nFurthermore, he said feedback from the public or shifts in commuting patterns could lead to adjustments to better meet the needs of the users, especially for deprived areas where certain communities are trapped by overbuilt tolled highways.\n\nRosli said innovations in construction or transit technology might enable more efficient station placements or designs that were not feasible during the original planning.\n\nHaving said that, he said that realignment comes with several potential impacts, especially station accessibility where the previous MRT projects have received backlash.\n\n&quot;Significant criticism has been voiced in the past with regards to poor access for MRT1 and MRT2 where some stations are placed next to highways and passenger&#39;s accessibility are much restricted while safety concerns become major issues.&quot;This requires new oversight and tight rounds of regulatory approvals, which are notably absence at the moment,&quot; he said.\n\nProperty overhang reducing TODs around MRT 3?\n\nTransport business consultant YS Chan said there are fewer TODs planned around MRT 3 than the other two MRTs before, given that 50 per cent of the property overhang in the Klang Valley area are for those above RM500,000.\n\n&quot;There is an oversupply of residential and office properties in the Klang Valley, with an overhang of 50 per cent for those valued at RM500,000 and above, which is within the price range of TOD developments.&quot;\n\n&quot;The MRT3 is just to complete the rail network in the Klang Valley and can proceed if funds are available. But like most existing office space and luxury condos, the return on investments (ROI) for both MRT3 and its transit-oriented developments (TODs) will be low,&quot; he added.\n\nChan expects lower ridership for MRT3 and lower number of developments around the stations as COVID-19 have changed the way people work, coupled with large corporation&#39;s lower appetite to invest in office buildings.\n\nAccording to him, large corporations are no longer interested investing in huge office buildings, which are more of a liability and no longer seen as prestigious. Chan said the TOD around MRT1 stations saw an equal share of successes and failures.\n\nHe said that while the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail project has not started yet, developers have approached TODs at MRT2 stations with extreme caution.\n\nWhile the MRT3 project is considered good as a proactive future investment, Rosli warned that overspending on projects in Klang Valley may increase the imbalance in development, suggesting that the funds for MRT3 should be spent in other regions in Malaysia.\n\n&quot;Consideration should be given to review budget allocation for MRT3, to be better spent on the provision of public transport in many other urban areas such as Kota Kinabalu, Johor Bharu, Melaka, Kuantan, Kuala Terengganu and Kota Bharu,&quot; he said.\n\n<a href='https://www.nst.com.my/business/economy/2024/08/1093395/transport-projects-experts-warn-property-investment-risks' target='_blank'>https://www.nst.com.my/business/economy/202...nvestment-risks</a>","author":"Jazted","pubDate":"Mon, 19 Aug 2024 21:26:50 +0800"}

{"title":"Experts warn of property investment risks, ","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5476991","description":"KUALA LUMPUR: Experts have warned property investors against trying to get ahead of the game in purchasing property near mega transport projects, citing risks of station cancellation or relocation that can impact property price value.\n\nFuture mega infrastructure projects can be a strong selling point for developers and property agents given that such projects tend to significantly increase the property value and rental rates around the projects.\n\nMalaysia has adopted the transit-oriented development (TOD) concept since 2001, starting with KL Sentral and expanded to Cyberjaya City Centre and PJ Sentral, among others.\n\nTOD is development centred on a rail or bus public transport station.\n\nProjects such as Mass Rapid Transit 3 (MRT3) and KL-Singapore high-speed rail (KL-SG HSR) instill a promise of connectivity are also creating the same pattern to the market value as seen in previous projects.\n\nThere are however significant risks to making property investments around these projects that may take several years to even get off the ground.\n\nIn fact, these projects also could be realigned or even cancelled at some point during the planning stage after considering the cost, technical challenges as well as public and political pressure.\n\nFor example, the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project was realigned two times involving the Section C route between Port Klang, Selangor and Mentakab, Pahang.\n\nThe first realignment in 2019 was rerouted through Negri Sembilan which shortened the total distance to 640km from 688km while the second change reverted the project to its original plan, making it 665km long now.\n\nAs for future projects like MRT3 Circle Line, the routes have been made public, but the alignments are not confirmed yet.\n\nThe government will decide on whether to proceed with the KL-SG HSR some time this year.\n\nTransport consultants said such infrastructure projects would take several years before the commencement of construction due to the process involved, alogn with other factors such as economic stability, political climate, and technical challenges.\n\nTransport consultant Wan Agyl Wan Hassan said the complexity of the journey from the announcement of a project to the start of construction involved four phases, including the feasibility studies and planning; approval process; tendering and contract award; and pre-construction activities.\n\nFor example, he said, the feasibility studies and planning usually takes one to two years, and the MRT3 project might take longer time due to the densely populated areas it will serve.\n\n&quot;Considering the lessons from MRT1 and MRT2, a more realistic expectation for MRT3&#39;s construction to begin might be within four to five years which accounts for potential delays, especially given the complexity and scale of the project,&quot; Wan Agyl told Business Times.\n\nThe MRT3 Circle Line will be connected to existing MRT, LRT, KTM, and Monorail lines through 10 interchange stations.  It will have 32 stations with 22 elevated stations, 7 underground stations and 3 elevated provisional stations.\n\nTransport consultant Rosli Khan said the current stations of the MRT3 alignment could change in the future, factoring in the need to adjust station locations to better serve changing population centres or commercial hubs.\n\nFurthermore, he said feedback from the public or shifts in commuting patterns could lead to adjustments to better meet the needs of the users, especially for deprived areas where certain communities are trapped by overbuilt tolled highways.\n\nRosli said innovations in construction or transit technology might enable more efficient station placements or designs that were not feasible during the original planning.\n\nHaving said that, he said that realignment comes with several potential impacts, especially station accessibility where the previous MRT projects have received backlash.\n\n&quot;Significant criticism has been voiced in the past with regards to poor access for MRT1 and MRT2 where some stations are placed next to highways and passenger&#39;s accessibility are much restricted while safety concerns become major issues.&quot;This requires new oversight and tight rounds of regulatory approvals, which are notably absence at the moment,&quot; he said.\n\nProperty overhang reducing TODs around MRT 3?\n\nTransport business consultant YS Chan said there are fewer TODs planned around MRT 3 than the other two MRTs before, given that 50 per cent of the property overhang in the Klang Valley area are for those above RM500,000.\n\n&quot;There is an oversupply of residential and office properties in the Klang Valley, with an overhang of 50 per cent for those valued at RM500,000 and above, which is within the price range of TOD developments.&quot;\n\n&quot;The MRT3 is just to complete the rail network in the Klang Valley and can proceed if funds are available. But like most existing office space and luxury condos, the return on investments (ROI) for both MRT3 and its transit-oriented developments (TODs) will be low,&quot; he added.\n\nChan expects lower ridership for MRT3 and lower number of developments around the stations as COVID-19 have changed the way people work, coupled with large corporation&#39;s lower appetite to invest in office buildings.\n\nAccording to him, large corporations are no longer interested investing in huge office buildings, which are more of a liability and no longer seen as prestigious. Chan said the TOD around MRT1 stations saw an equal share of successes and failures.\n\nHe said that while the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail project has not started yet, developers have approached TODs at MRT2 stations with extreme caution.\n\nWhile the MRT3 project is considered good as a proactive future investment, Rosli warned that overspending on projects in Klang Valley may increase the imbalance in development, suggesting that the funds for MRT3 should be spent in other regions in Malaysia.\n\n&quot;Consideration should be given to review budget allocation for MRT3, to be better spent on the provision of public transport in many other urban areas such as Kota Kinabalu, Johor Bharu, Melaka, Kuantan, Kuala Terengganu and Kota Bharu,&quot; he said.\n\n<a href='https://www.nst.com.my/business/economy/2024/08/1093395/transport-projects-experts-warn-property-investment-risks' target='_blank'>https://www.nst.com.my/business/economy/202...nvestment-risks</a>","author":"Jazted","pubDate":"Mon, 19 Aug 2024 21:26:50 +0800"}

{"title":"Experts warn of property investment risks, ","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5476991","description":"KUALA LUMPUR: Experts have warned property investors against trying to get ahead of the game in purchasing property near mega transport projects, citing risks of station cancellation or relocation that can impact property price value.\n\nFuture mega infrastructure projects can be a strong selling point for developers and property agents given that such projects tend to significantly increase the property value and rental rates around the projects.\n\nMalaysia has adopted the transit-oriented development (TOD) concept since 2001, starting with KL Sentral and expanded to Cyberjaya City Centre and PJ Sentral, among others.\n\nTOD is development centred on a rail or bus public transport station.\n\nProjects such as Mass Rapid Transit 3 (MRT3) and KL-Singapore high-speed rail (KL-SG HSR) instill a promise of connectivity are also creating the same pattern to the market value as seen in previous projects.\n\nThere are however significant risks to making property investments around these projects that may take several years to even get off the ground.\n\nIn fact, these projects also could be realigned or even cancelled at some point during the planning stage after considering the cost, technical challenges as well as public and political pressure.\n\nFor example, the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project was realigned two times involving the Section C route between Port Klang, Selangor and Mentakab, Pahang.\n\nThe first realignment in 2019 was rerouted through Negri Sembilan which shortened the total distance to 640km from 688km while the second change reverted the project to its original plan, making it 665km long now.\n\nAs for future projects like MRT3 Circle Line, the routes have been made public, but the alignments are not confirmed yet.\n\nThe government will decide on whether to proceed with the KL-SG HSR some time this year.\n\nTransport consultants said such infrastructure projects would take several years before the commencement of construction due to the process involved, alogn with other factors such as economic stability, political climate, and technical challenges.\n\nTransport consultant Wan Agyl Wan Hassan said the complexity of the journey from the announcement of a project to the start of construction involved four phases, including the feasibility studies and planning; approval process; tendering and contract award; and pre-construction activities.\n\nFor example, he said, the feasibility studies and planning usually takes one to two years, and the MRT3 project might take longer time due to the densely populated areas it will serve.\n\n&quot;Considering the lessons from MRT1 and MRT2, a more realistic expectation for MRT3&#39;s construction to begin might be within four to five years which accounts for potential delays, especially given the complexity and scale of the project,&quot; Wan Agyl told Business Times.\n\nThe MRT3 Circle Line will be connected to existing MRT, LRT, KTM, and Monorail lines through 10 interchange stations.  It will have 32 stations with 22 elevated stations, 7 underground stations and 3 elevated provisional stations.\n\nTransport consultant Rosli Khan said the current stations of the MRT3 alignment could change in the future, factoring in the need to adjust station locations to better serve changing population centres or commercial hubs.\n\nFurthermore, he said feedback from the public or shifts in commuting patterns could lead to adjustments to better meet the needs of the users, especially for deprived areas where certain communities are trapped by overbuilt tolled highways.\n\nRosli said innovations in construction or transit technology might enable more efficient station placements or designs that were not feasible during the original planning.\n\nHaving said that, he said that realignment comes with several potential impacts, especially station accessibility where the previous MRT projects have received backlash.\n\n&quot;Significant criticism has been voiced in the past with regards to poor access for MRT1 and MRT2 where some stations are placed next to highways and passenger&#39;s accessibility are much restricted while safety concerns become major issues.&quot;This requires new oversight and tight rounds of regulatory approvals, which are notably absence at the moment,&quot; he said.\n\nProperty overhang reducing TODs around MRT 3?\n\nTransport business consultant YS Chan said there are fewer TODs planned around MRT 3 than the other two MRTs before, given that 50 per cent of the property overhang in the Klang Valley area are for those above RM500,000.\n\n&quot;There is an oversupply of residential and office properties in the Klang Valley, with an overhang of 50 per cent for those valued at RM500,000 and above, which is within the price range of TOD developments.&quot;\n\n&quot;The MRT3 is just to complete the rail network in the Klang Valley and can proceed if funds are available. But like most existing office space and luxury condos, the return on investments (ROI) for both MRT3 and its transit-oriented developments (TODs) will be low,&quot; he added.\n\nChan expects lower ridership for MRT3 and lower number of developments around the stations as COVID-19 have changed the way people work, coupled with large corporation&#39;s lower appetite to invest in office buildings.\n\nAccording to him, large corporations are no longer interested investing in huge office buildings, which are more of a liability and no longer seen as prestigious. Chan said the TOD around MRT1 stations saw an equal share of successes and failures.\n\nHe said that while the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail project has not started yet, developers have approached TODs at MRT2 stations with extreme caution.\n\nWhile the MRT3 project is considered good as a proactive future investment, Rosli warned that overspending on projects in Klang Valley may increase the imbalance in development, suggesting that the funds for MRT3 should be spent in other regions in Malaysia.\n\n&quot;Consideration should be given to review budget allocation for MRT3, to be better spent on the provision of public transport in many other urban areas such as Kota Kinabalu, Johor Bharu, Melaka, Kuantan, Kuala Terengganu and Kota Bharu,&quot; he said.\n\n<a href='https://www.nst.com.my/business/economy/2024/08/1093395/transport-projects-experts-warn-property-investment-risks' target='_blank'>https://www.nst.com.my/business/economy/202...nvestment-risks</a>","author":"Jazted","pubDate":"Mon, 19 Aug 2024 21:26:50 +0800"}

Not sure whats the actual word for such concept.\nThey&#39;re 2 in JB now, eco galleria and eco palladium. weekends are full, occupancy rate is like maybe 40% after 4-5 years of completion as of now. \n\ni&#39;ve been renting a unit here for 2 years. As business is picking up good, we&#39;re thinking of buying because:\n1. we are staying at this area ( our house is also just 3mins away from here).\n2. kids school is also just 1min away from here\n3. business is very stable and we wanna get a unit and we can put in more money into the reno and stuff.\n\nBut i&#39;ve always been wary about such commercial projects in MY, such a shoplots in Condo projects, or shoplots in such semi-shopping centre thing. Always see them half-dead or in the end always up in lelong. usually if one day u wanna sell, its impossible to sell.\n\nWhat are your takes in such projects?

The installed unit is cheaper and doesn&#39;t come with a tabletop. This partly contributes to me getting the unit as I even started to look for the cabinet maker to installed the floating cabinet body.\n\nI informed the developer and they admitted the mistake and sent a new specification. They are not able to replace it as all houses already VP and dismantlle and redo will have technical and safety issue. The developer offer to give me another alternative basin design with cabinet but do not disclose to other purchasers. The discussion went for about 3 weeks plus and they bring me to a wild goose chase - from getting the cabinet maker and then cancelled at the last minute, getting me to get the list of items for claim and reimbursement. After realizing that they are just playing and delaying, i decided to end the deal.\n\nI have screenshots of whatsapp message from their QAQC manager and Executive Director and also recorded conversation. My plan now is to seek for the stakeholder lawyer to hold the final 5% payment. However, this is not considered a defect, so not sure if this works. At the same tiime I am also seeking compensation for my expenses and inconvenience. I also requested that any replacement would need to be certified by a professional engineer from the majlis. Is there any llegal avenue to compel the Developer to compensate all purchasers?\n\nUp till now, other purchasers are kept in the dark. Coincidentally, there is a lucky draw organized by thee developer this weekend. Would it be a good idea to approach all purchasers and made this known?\n\nThis developer is public listed and has considerable reputation at my state.\n\nAny advice.

Since they blame DBKL didn&#39;t create any extra parking for them. They said wife got car, child got car.

There&#39;s a higher-end condo next to mine, just the same bloody problem.\n\nI understand people parking on housing areas, I think that&#39;s less on an issue. This is a farking main road.

{"title":"Will One City thrive in the future?, Property investment insights needed","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5492366","description":"Hi everyone,\n\nI&#39;m new to the property market and am about to purchase my first home at nearly 40. I wanted to get some advice on whether a currently &quot;dead&quot; area can bounce back and thrive over time. Specifically, I&#39;m considering The Square @ One City.\n\nTo give some context, I lived overseas for the past decade and returned 2 years ago but will be moving abroad again in February 2025. The main appeal of One City for me is its location (close to my family) and budget (freehold under 300k, in excellent condition). I’m primarily looking for a place to stay when I visit, which is typically once or twice a year for about a month each time.

Selling prices start from RM468,800. The project will also offer retail lots, including drive-thru units. Further details are forthcoming. \n\nThe TOD project is located within close proximity to the Jalan Templer KTM Station (about 330m away) and the Petaling KTM Station (450m).\n\nCommenting on the acquisition, Mah Sing founder and group managing director Tan Sri Leong Hoy Kum said, “The new land acquisition along Old Klang Road, near Jalan Gasing, taps into the potential of a well-established and matured neighbourhood. The prime location connects both Petaling Jaya and KL city centre.”\n\nThe statement added that M Aurora will be equipped with several sustainable features, including low-consumption lifts, LED lighting in common areas, rooftop solar panels, and automated waste collection systems. \n\nThe unveiling of M Aurora follows the success of the M Oscar condominium launched in 2019, within the vicinity of Old Klang Road. M Oscar has been fully sold, and was handed over in April this year.\n\nThe latest acquisition marks Mah Sing’s fourth land purchase in 2024. The developer is on track to achieve its full-year sales target set at RM2.5 billion, supported by its sales performance of RM1.66 billion in the first eight months, which it said was largely attributed to the M Series residential developments. \n\n“Our robust financial position, with low net gearing of 0.1 times, enables us to confidently pursue growth opportunities across varied project types. Whether niche, fast-turnaround projects or large townships, we are ready to seize opportunities in the current market,” Leong said. \n\nEdited ByRacheal Lee Mei Nyee\n\nQuoted from:\n<a href='https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/733054' target='_blank'>https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/733054</a>","author":"eddietwh","pubDate":"Thu, 07 Nov 2024 15:32:48 +0800"}

On the main road outside the condo, it is 1 lane each way. However, idiots have parked their cars ON BOTH SIDES of the road. We can barely get one car through. They are parked dangerously at the bends and block vision of incoming traffic. Very dangerous and reckless.\n\nMyself and other residents regularly report to DBKL. They come and issue saman, as they said that&#39;s the best they can do.\n\nIn the Whatsapp group, I asked them, if your unit has 1 car park, what makes you think you have a right to get more carpark. Since they blame DBKL didn&#39;t create any extra parking for them. They said wife got car, child got car. Bloody hell, not common sense that either you move out or manage with that one car?\n\nThis is not some PPR. It&#39;s a mid range condo. There&#39;s a higher-end condo next to mine, just the same bloody problem.\n\nI understand people parking on housing areas, I think that&#39;s less on an issue. This is a farking main road. And those who park errantly despite DBKL ample signages, warning and saman, they are not repentant.

Selling prices start from RM468,800. The project will also offer retail lots, including drive-thru units. Further details are forthcoming. \n\nThe TOD project is located within close proximity to the Jalan Templer KTM Station (about 330m away) and the Petaling KTM Station (450m).\n\nCommenting on the acquisition, Mah Sing founder and group managing director Tan Sri Leong Hoy Kum said, “The new land acquisition along Old Klang Road, near Jalan Gasing, taps into the potential of a well-established and matured neighbourhood. The prime location connects both Petaling Jaya and KL city centre.”\n\nThe statement added that M Aurora will be equipped with several sustainable features, including low-consumption lifts, LED lighting in common areas, rooftop solar panels, and automated waste collection systems. \n\nThe unveiling of M Aurora follows the success of the M Oscar condominium launched in 2019, within the vicinity of Old Klang Road. M Oscar has been fully sold, and was handed over in April this year.\n\nThe latest acquisition marks Mah Sing’s fourth land purchase in 2024. The developer is on track to achieve its full-year sales target set at RM2.5 billion, supported by its sales performance of RM1.66 billion in the first eight months, which it said was largely attributed to the M Series residential developments. \n\n“Our robust financial position, with low net gearing of 0.1 times, enables us to confidently pursue growth opportunities across varied project types. Whether niche, fast-turnaround projects or large townships, we are ready to seize opportunities in the current market,” Leong said. \n\nEdited ByRacheal Lee Mei Nyee\n\nQuoted from:\n<a href='https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/733054' target='_blank'>https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/733054</a>","author":"eddietwh","pubDate":"Thu, 07 Nov 2024 15:32:48 +0800"}

{"title":"Will One City thrive in the future?, Property investment insights needed","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5492366","description":"Hi everyone,\n\nI&#39;m new to the property market and am about to purchase my first home at nearly 40. I wanted to get some advice on whether a currently &quot;dead&quot; area can bounce back and thrive over time. Specifically, I&#39;m considering The Square @ One City.\n\nTo give some context, I lived overseas for the past decade and returned 2 years ago but will be moving abroad again in February 2025. The main appeal of One City for me is its location (close to my family) and budget (freehold under 300k, in excellent condition). I’m primarily looking for a place to stay when I visit, which is typically once or twice a year for about a month each time. Right now, I’m staying with family, but I&#39;d prefer having my own space during future visits.\n\nI’m also rushing to purchase because I can still qualify for a 30-year loan while holding my current job, but I will be resigning by the end of this month as I need to leave in the next 4 months.\n\nIn the long term, I’m thinking about potential use if my only child decides to study here for university or if my husband and I retire back here one day. Or in case my circumstances change and we need to move back here again within the next few years.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on how this area might develop over the next 10-15 years? Do you think it’s a good investment for someone with my circumstances?\n\nThe unit I am looking at is currently tenanted at RM1600 monthly.\n\nThank you  ","author":"Ahjumma","category":"Investment","pubDate":"Mon, 04 Nov 2024 10:38:37 +0800"}

Selling prices start from RM468,800. The project will also offer retail lots, including drive-thru units. Further details are forthcoming. \n\nThe TOD project is located within close proximity to the Jalan Templer KTM Station (about 330m away) and the Petaling KTM Station (450m).\n\nCommenting on the acquisition, Mah Sing founder and group managing director Tan Sri Leong Hoy Kum said, “The new land acquisition along Old Klang Road, near Jalan Gasing, taps into the potential of a well-established and matured neighbourhood. The prime location connects both Petaling Jaya and KL city centre.”\n\nThe statement added that M Aurora will be equipped with several sustainable features, including low-consumption lifts, LED lighting in common areas, rooftop solar panels, and automated waste collection systems. \n\nThe unveiling of M Aurora follows the success of the M Oscar condominium launched in 2019, within the vicinity of Old Klang Road. M Oscar has been fully sold, and was handed over in April this year.\n\nThe latest acquisition marks Mah Sing’s fourth land purchase in 2024. The developer is on track to achieve its full-year sales target set at RM2.5 billion, supported by its sales performance of RM1.66 billion in the first eight months, which it said was largely attributed to the M Series residential developments. \n\n“Our robust financial position, with low net gearing of 0.1 times, enables us to confidently pursue growth opportunities across varied project types. Whether niche, fast-turnaround projects or large townships, we are ready to seize opportunities in the current market,” Leong said. \n\nEdited ByRacheal Lee Mei Nyee\n\nQuoted from:\n<a href='https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/733054' target='_blank'>https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/733054</a>","author":"eddietwh","pubDate":"Thu, 07 Nov 2024 15:32:48 +0800"}

{"title":"Will One City thrive in the future?, Property investment insights needed","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5492366","description":"Hi everyone,\n\nI&#39;m new to the property market and am about to purchase my first home at nearly 40. I wanted to get some advice on whether a currently &quot;dead&quot; area can bounce back and thrive over time. Specifically, I&#39;m considering The Square @ One City.\n\nTo give some context, I lived overseas for the past decade and returned 2 years ago but will be moving abroad again in February 2025. The main appeal of One City for me is its location (close to my family) and budget (freehold under 300k, in excellent condition). I’m primarily looking for a place to stay when I visit, which is typically once or twice a year for about a month each time. Right now, I’m staying with family, but I&#39;d prefer having my own space during future visits.\n\nI’m also rushing to purchase because I can still qualify for a 30-year loan while holding my current job, but I will be resigning by the end of this month as I need to leave in the next 4 months.\n\nIn the long term, I’m thinking about potential use if my only child decides to study here for university or if my husband and I retire back here one day. Or in case my circumstances change and we need to move back here again within the next few years.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on how this area might develop over the next 10-15 years? Do you think it’s a good investment for someone with my circumstances?\n\nThe unit I am looking at is currently tenanted at RM1600 monthly.\n\nThank you  ","author":"Ahjumma","category":"Investment","pubDate":"Mon, 04 Nov 2024 10:38:37 +0800"}

Selling prices start from RM468,800. The project will also offer retail lots, including drive-thru units. Further details are forthcoming. \n\nThe TOD project is located within close proximity to the Jalan Templer KTM Station (about 330m away) and the Petaling KTM Station (450m).\n\nCommenting on the acquisition, Mah Sing founder and group managing director Tan Sri Leong Hoy Kum said, “The new land acquisition along Old Klang Road, near Jalan Gasing, taps into the potential of a well-established and matured neighbourhood. The prime location connects both Petaling Jaya and KL city centre.”\n\nThe statement added that M Aurora will be equipped with several sustainable features, including low-consumption lifts, LED lighting in common areas, rooftop solar panels, and automated waste collection systems. \n\nThe unveiling of M Aurora follows the success of the M Oscar condominium launched in 2019, within the vicinity of Old Klang Road. M Oscar has been fully sold, and was handed over in April this year.\n\nThe latest acquisition marks Mah Sing’s fourth land purchase in 2024. The developer is on track to achieve its full-year sales target set at RM2.5 billion, supported by its sales performance of RM1.66 billion in the first eight months, which it said was largely attributed to the M Series residential developments. \n\n“Our robust financial position, with low net gearing of 0.1 times, enables us to confidently pursue growth opportunities across varied project types. Whether niche, fast-turnaround projects or large townships, we are ready to seize opportunities in the current market,” Leong said. \n\nEdited ByRacheal Lee Mei Nyee\n\nQuoted from:\n<a href='https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/733054' target='_blank'>https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/733054</a>","author":"eddietwh","pubDate":"Thu, 07 Nov 2024 15:32:48 +0800"}

The project’s location and scale offer significant potential for capital appreciation, aligning perfectly with our focus on creating long-term value.\n\nThe transaction, while subject to shareholders’ approval as a related party transaction, is expected to contribute positively to the group&#39;s performance in the medium to long term.\n\nRadium stated that it has a “proven track record in developing successful urban projects, including the ongoing Suite Canselor, Residensi Desa Timur, and Residensi Radium Arena developments”.\n\nThis proposed acquisition positions Radium to benefit from several macro trends: \n\n1) Urbanisation and the growing demand for integrated living spaces; \n\n2)increasing preference for properties with excellent public transport connectivity; and \n\n3) The potential for property value appreciation in well-located TOD zones.\n","author":"Pixtel","pubDate":"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 20:18:08 +0800"}

I wanted to get some advice on whether a currently &quot;dead&quot; area can bounce back and thrive over time. Specifically, I&#39;m considering The Square @ One City.\n\nTo give some context, I lived overseas for the past decade and returned 2 years ago but will be moving abroad again in February 2025. The main appeal of One City for me is its location (close to my family) and budget (freehold under 300k, in excellent condition). I’m primarily looking for a place to stay when I visit, which is typically once or twice a year for about a month each time. Right now, I’m staying with family, but I&#39;d prefer having my own space during future visits.\n\nI’m also rushing to purchase because I can still qualify for a 30-year loan while holding my current job, but I will be resigning by the end of this month as I need to leave in the next 4 months.\n\nIn the long term, I’m thinking about potential use if my only child decides to study here for university or if my husband and I retire back here one day.

Selling prices start from RM468,800. The project will also offer retail lots, including drive-thru units. Further details are forthcoming. \n\nThe TOD project is located within close proximity to the Jalan Templer KTM Station (about 330m away) and the Petaling KTM Station (450m).\n\nCommenting on the acquisition, Mah Sing founder and group managing director Tan Sri Leong Hoy Kum said, “The new land acquisition along Old Klang Road, near Jalan Gasing, taps into the potential of a well-established and matured neighbourhood. The prime location connects both Petaling Jaya and KL city centre.”\n\nThe statement added that M Aurora will be equipped with several sustainable features, including low-consumption lifts, LED lighting in common areas, rooftop solar panels, and automated waste collection systems. \n\nThe unveiling of M Aurora follows the success of the M Oscar condominium launched in 2019, within the vicinity of Old Klang Road. M Oscar has been fully sold, and was handed over in April this year.\n\nThe latest acquisition marks Mah Sing’s fourth land purchase in 2024. The developer is on track to achieve its full-year sales target set at RM2.5 billion, supported by its sales performance of RM1.66 billion in the first eight months, which it said was largely attributed to the M Series residential developments. \n\n“Our robust financial position, with low net gearing of 0.1 times, enables us to confidently pursue growth opportunities across varied project types. Whether niche, fast-turnaround projects or large townships, we are ready to seize opportunities in the current market,” Leong said. \n\nEdited ByRacheal Lee Mei Nyee\n\nQuoted from:\n<a href='https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/733054' target='_blank'>https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/733054</a>","author":"eddietwh","pubDate":"Thu, 07 Nov 2024 15:32:48 +0800"}

The project’s location and scale offer significant potential for capital appreciation, aligning perfectly with our focus on creating long-term value.\n\nThe transaction, while subject to shareholders’ approval as a related party transaction, is expected to contribute positively to the group&#39;s performance in the medium to long term.\n\nRadium stated that it has a “proven track record in developing successful urban projects, including the ongoing Suite Canselor, Residensi Desa Timur, and Residensi Radium Arena developments”.\n\nThis proposed acquisition positions Radium to benefit from several macro trends: \n\n1) Urbanisation and the growing demand for integrated living spaces; \n\n2)increasing preference for properties with excellent public transport connectivity; and \n\n3) The potential for property value appreciation in well-located TOD zones.\n","author":"Pixtel","pubDate":"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 20:18:08 +0800"}

Specifically, I&#39;m considering The Square @ One City.\n\nTo give some context, I lived overseas for the past decade and returned 2 years ago but will be moving abroad again in February 2025. The main appeal of One City for me is its location (close to my family) and budget (freehold under 300k, in excellent condition). I’m primarily looking for a place to stay when I visit, which is typically once or twice a year for about a month each time. Right now, I’m staying with family, but I&#39;d prefer having my own space during future visits.\n\nI’m also rushing to purchase because I can still qualify for a 30-year loan while holding my current job, but I will be resigning by the end of this month as I need to leave in the next 4 months.\n\nIn the long term, I’m thinking about potential use if my only child decides to study here for university or if my husband and I retire back here one day. Or in case my circumstances change and we need to move back here again within the next few years.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on how this area might develop over the next 10-15 years? Do you think it’s a good investment for someone with my circumstances?\n\nThe unit I am looking at is currently tenanted at RM1600 monthly.\n\nThank you  ","author":"Ahjumma","category":"Investment","pubDate":"Mon, 04 Nov 2024 10:38:37 +0800"}

Selling prices start from RM468,800. The project will also offer retail lots, including drive-thru units. Further details are forthcoming. \n\nThe TOD project is located within close proximity to the Jalan Templer KTM Station (about 330m away) and the Petaling KTM Station (450m).\n\nCommenting on the acquisition, Mah Sing founder and group managing director Tan Sri Leong Hoy Kum said, “The new land acquisition along Old Klang Road, near Jalan Gasing, taps into the potential of a well-established and matured neighbourhood. The prime location connects both Petaling Jaya and KL city centre.”\n\nThe statement added that M Aurora will be equipped with several sustainable features, including low-consumption lifts, LED lighting in common areas, rooftop solar panels, and automated waste collection systems. \n\nThe unveiling of M Aurora follows the success of the M Oscar condominium launched in 2019, within the vicinity of Old Klang Road. M Oscar has been fully sold, and was handed over in April this year.\n\nThe latest acquisition marks Mah Sing’s fourth land purchase in 2024. The developer is on track to achieve its full-year sales target set at RM2.5 billion, supported by its sales performance of RM1.66 billion in the first eight months, which it said was largely attributed to the M Series residential developments. \n\n“Our robust financial position, with low net gearing of 0.1 times, enables us to confidently pursue growth opportunities across varied project types. Whether niche, fast-turnaround projects or large townships, we are ready to seize opportunities in the current market,” Leong said. \n\nEdited ByRacheal Lee Mei Nyee\n\nQuoted from:\n<a href='https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/733054' target='_blank'>https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/733054</a>","author":"eddietwh","pubDate":"Thu, 07 Nov 2024 15:32:48 +0800"}

The project’s location and scale offer significant potential for capital appreciation, aligning perfectly with our focus on creating long-term value.\n\nThe transaction, while subject to shareholders’ approval as a related party transaction, is expected to contribute positively to the group&#39;s performance in the medium to long term.\n\nRadium stated that it has a “proven track record in developing successful urban projects, including the ongoing Suite Canselor, Residensi Desa Timur, and Residensi Radium Arena developments”.\n\nThis proposed acquisition positions Radium to benefit from several macro trends: \n\n1) Urbanisation and the growing demand for integrated living spaces; \n\n2)increasing preference for properties with excellent public transport connectivity; and \n\n3) The potential for property value appreciation in well-located TOD zones.\n","author":"Pixtel","pubDate":"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 20:18:08 +0800"}

{"title":"Rent or Own Stay, Would like some advice","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5497877","description":"Hi everyone,\n\nWould just like some of your kind advice for my current situation:\n\nI bought an older condo early this year with the help of my parents for half of the down payment, the condo in question is Tropika Paradise in USJ 17 Subang Jaya.\n\nBought it for RM400k+ and my monthly repayment is now RM1,680 per month with the maintenance fee being RM330.\n\nThe condition of the interior is okay but it&#39;s a bit dated and old, so if I were to stay there I have to renovate the place which will have another major cost.\n\nI&#39;m having a bit of trouble deciding whether I should rent this out or slowly save for the renovation cost and live on my own, as right now after paying for the installment and maintenance fee, I find it hard to save.\n\nJust trying to look for your point of view, if you were in my shoes. I have a bit of reservation with renting as I already bought some nice furniture&#39;s for it (which is still being kept in the store, as we have asked them to deliver it when I&#39;m ready to move in) and I&#39;m not sure if I am able to handle it if I get a bad tenant.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n","author":"6996","pubDate":"Wed, 04 Dec 2024 09:31:18 +0800"}

The project’s location and scale offer significant potential for capital appreciation, aligning perfectly with our focus on creating long-term value.\n\nThe transaction, while subject to shareholders’ approval as a related party transaction, is expected to contribute positively to the group&#39;s performance in the medium to long term.\n\nRadium stated that it has a “proven track record in developing successful urban projects, including the ongoing Suite Canselor, Residensi Desa Timur, and Residensi Radium Arena developments”.\n\nThis proposed acquisition positions Radium to benefit from several macro trends: \n\n1) Urbanisation and the growing demand for integrated living spaces; \n\n2)increasing preference for properties with excellent public transport connectivity; and \n\n3) The potential for property value appreciation in well-located TOD zones.\n","author":"Pixtel","pubDate":"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 20:18:08 +0800"}

The project’s location and scale offer significant potential for capital appreciation, aligning perfectly with our focus on creating long-term value.\n\nThe transaction, while subject to shareholders’ approval as a related party transaction, is expected to contribute positively to the group&#39;s performance in the medium to long term.\n\nRadium stated that it has a “proven track record in developing successful urban projects, including the ongoing Suite Canselor, Residensi Desa Timur, and Residensi Radium Arena developments”.\n\nThis proposed acquisition positions Radium to benefit from several macro trends: \n\n1) Urbanisation and the growing demand for integrated living spaces; \n\n2)increasing preference for properties with excellent public transport connectivity; and \n\n3) The potential for property value appreciation in well-located TOD zones.\n","author":"Pixtel","pubDate":"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 20:18:08 +0800"}

The project’s location and scale offer significant potential for capital appreciation, aligning perfectly with our focus on creating long-term value.\n\nThe transaction, while subject to shareholders’ approval as a related party transaction, is expected to contribute positively to the group&#39;s performance in the medium to long term.\n\nRadium stated that it has a “proven track record in developing successful urban projects, including the ongoing Suite Canselor, Residensi Desa Timur, and Residensi Radium Arena developments”.\n\nThis proposed acquisition positions Radium to benefit from several macro trends: \n\n1) Urbanisation and the growing demand for integrated living spaces; \n\n2)increasing preference for properties with excellent public transport connectivity; and \n\n3) The potential for property value appreciation in well-located TOD zones.\n","author":"Pixtel","pubDate":"Mon, 25 Nov 2024 20:18:08 +0800"}

{"title":"rampai court land grab part 2, redevelopment of rampai court","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5499437","description":"its that that time again.Five years after the issue cooled from covid redevelopment of rampai court phases one and two are again in full sw3ing.\n \n  First rampai court phase 1 the 220 units on 5 acres of land.\n\n   Their mananagement has announced  that 70 % of the owners have signed a statutory declaration with the new development to redevelop their land.That is still short of 100 % required and the new rule announced by Nga Kor Ming of 80 % target has yet to be reached.The quotas announced have yet to become law.\n   Phas1 is of low density,about half of phase 2 and has dual frontage .Any developer will opt to covert the land to commercial on two frontages and the build service apartments on top.Land owners are promised up to compensation of 1 Unit not less than 1000FS and whether any further top up is necessary is umclear.Unit holders will pay commercial rates for water,electricity,higher service charges and assessments.\n  Currently and in the near future there is a property overhang,units over 700k in mediocre locations are unsaleable,those over 500 K are difficult to sell,and there is a glut of 300k apartments of the rumah WIP variety.\n  It seems the assigned developer a little known co,called bangsar development jv with a china company is offering a bankguarantee to compensate land owners if the project fails.\n  A bank guarantee works this way,if you are guaranteeing rm80m worth of property you must depositr rm80 into a bank for safekeeping to be used when necessary.This bank guarantee is usually valid only for a year and must be renewed.The gurantee is useless if not renewed.\n  It is feasible for phase 1 to be redeloped owing to the very poor condition and state of maintenance for decades ,it has commercial value and has low density .However factors in doubt include an unstable market,weak developer and dubious bank guarantees.A very reputable lawyer should be consulted on this matter.\n Residents will be getting the equivalent of rumah WIPs which are a plenty and for sale everywhere and getting 3 br and 2 baths and living in 50 storey pigeion coops.It is probably worthwhile if they are more rentable than the current 40 year old apartments in disrepair.A far cry from the 700k condos promised by the previous developer to reflect reality.What about phase 2?   \n\nthe safest option for redevelopment would be the key to key concept.\n    This means you only surrender your land when your unit has been built \n    and you surrender your land and unit  after delivery.\n    This will require the land to be split,some units built first and handed over first.\n    Then what has been surrendered later is up to the developer to do what he likes.\n    Unfortunately key to key is not possible in phase 1 if it is a commercial development with \n    service apartments on top.","author":"Rampai Court Resident","category":"Investment","pubDate":"Fri, 13 Dec 2024 15:07:03 +0800"}

{"title":"rampai court land grab part 2, redevelopment of rampai court","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5499437","description":"its that that time again.Five years after the issue cooled from covid redevelopment of rampai court phases one and two are again in full sw3ing.\n \n  First rampai court phase 1 the 220 units on 5 acres of land.\n\n   Their mananagement has announced  that 70 % of the owners have signed a statutory declaration with the new development to redevelop their land.That is still short of 100 % required and the new rule announced by Nga Kor Ming of 80 % target has yet to be reached.The quotas announced have yet to become law.\n   Phas1 is of low density,about half of phase 2 and has dual frontage .Any developer will opt to covert the land to commercial on two frontages and the build service apartments on top.Land owners are promised up to compensation of 1 Unit not less than 1000FS and whether any further top up is necessary is umclear.Unit holders will pay commercial rates for water,electricity,higher service charges and assessments.\n  Currently and in the near future there is a property overhang,units over 700k in mediocre locations are unsaleable,those over 500 K are difficult to sell,and there is a glut of 300k apartments of the rumah WIP variety.\n  It seems the assigned developer a little known co,called bangsar development jv with a china company is offering a bankguarantee to compensate land owners if the project fails.\n  A bank guarantee works this way,if you are guaranteeing rm80m worth of property you must depositr rm80 into a bank for safekeeping to be used when necessary.This bank guarantee is usually valid only for a year and must be renewed.The gurantee is useless if not renewed.\n  It is feasible for phase 1 to be redeloped owing to the very poor condition and state of maintenance for decades ,it has commercial value and has low density .However factors in doubt include an unstable market,weak developer and dubious bank guarantees.A very reputable lawyer should be consulted on this matter.\n Residents will be getting the equivalent of rumah WIPs which are a plenty and for sale everywhere and getting 3 br and 2 baths and living in 50 storey pigeion coops.It is probably worthwhile if they are more rentable than the current 40 year old apartments in disrepair.A far cry from the 700k condos promised by the previous developer to reflect reality.What about phase 2?   \n\nthe safest option for redevelopment would be the key to key concept.\n    This means you only surrender your land when your unit has been built \n    and you surrender your land and unit  after delivery.\n    This will require the land to be split,some units built first and handed over first.\n    Then what has been surrendered later is up to the developer to do what he likes.\n    Unfortunately key to key is not possible in phase 1 if it is a commercial development with \n    service apartments on top.","author":"Rampai Court Resident","category":"Investment","pubDate":"Fri, 13 Dec 2024 15:07:03 +0800"}

{"title":"Rent or Own Stay, Would like some advice","link":"http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5497877","description":"Hi everyone,\n\nWould just like some of your kind advice for my current situation:\n\nI bought an older condo early this year with the help of my parents for half of the down payment, the condo in question is Tropika Paradise in USJ 17 Subang Jaya.\n\nBought it for RM400k+ and my monthly repayment is now RM1,680 per month with the maintenance fee being RM330.\n\nThe condition of the interior is okay but it&#39;s a bit dated and old, so if I were to stay there I have to renovate the place which will have another major cost.\n\nI&#39;m having a bit of trouble deciding whether I should rent this out or slowly save for the renovation cost and live on my own, as right now after paying for the installment and maintenance fee, I find it hard to save.\n\nJust trying to look for your point of view, if you were in my shoes. I have a bit of reservation with renting as I already bought some nice furniture&#39;s for it (which is still being kept in the store, as we have asked them to deliver it when I&#39;m ready to move in) and I&#39;m not sure if I am able to handle it if I get a bad tenant.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n","author":"6996","pubDate":"Wed, 04 Dec 2024 09:31:18 +0800"}

His memory is very much weaken and is too weak to walk. My mother is very old as well, although still considered strong at her age, she needs more time to climb the staires. Thus, I wish to buy a lift apartment to live with them. My salary is around 3400 basic before deductions, my monthly after deductions total is around 3600 to 3800 plus 750 rental income. \n\nMy family is living in a walk up flat in Sri Endah worth around 160k to 200k, and I have another one in Sri Kembangan worth around 200k above. I plan to sell that one, and get a loan to buy a 3 rooms lift apartment in KL with good convenience such as market, shops just on the ground floor, less than 1 hour drive to government hospital, train station. After we move in, we would be renting out the one we are living in then.\n\nAnother option is to sell both houses, get a dual key, and rent out the studio unit. But doing so, might need to rent outside during the transaction period.\n\nI have a few questions, should I engage an agent to help me do all these transactions and loan application or DIY? What will be the price difference? I can&#39;t afford to gamble on this, so I am more toward completed unit. Is this way more expensive?

I found DMC is the best, as it is an idea that stays in between non-G&amp;G individual title units and stratified community. \n\n2. It almost has all the pros of both sides and eliminated all the cons from both sides. Do you agree?\n\n3. Currently, lots of high-rise living folks facing maintenance fee problem, especially those not already new, ditched by developer, managed by own condo. \n\n4. Many moans for facing mismanaging jmb, not efficient, corruption, mis conduct, and also due to current market trend of everything&#39;s price also hike, and leads to drastic increase of management fee. Many already cant stand with it\n\n5. Then condo folk cabut go for outskirt landed, follow the sheep almost all go into the popular stratified community idea township. \n\n6. It is actually same kind of condo management idea, where everybody share share pay for the fancy facility. \n\n7. Who manage? OfCourse developer. But it is just for now and not forever, because what if in the future the developer charge kaw2 then what? Kick out the developer and form jmb to manage own self? \n\n8. Yes then go back to the condo management loop, all kind of mismanagement problem, fee hiking problem again.\n\n9. Now then what about individual title? Good? No need month month pay management fee? Yes, big saving, but no security, not save, property value drop. \n\n10. Look at SS2, why ppl willing to buy condo there at almost the same price of adjacent landed property? Thats why....\n\n11.

I have two cars, but I&#39;m starting to like using the MRT as I can walk more. \n\nI am humbly seeking opinions/views on Setia Sky Residence, as well as if any sifus here got any advice on what to look out for/any other alternatives to Setia Sky Residence.\n\nAny thoughts/opinions is much appreciated.\n\n ","author":"skathemuzzi","pubDate":"Mon, 02 Dec 2024 21:14:32 +0800"}

After we move in, we would be renting out the one we are living in then.\n\nAnother option is to sell both houses, get a dual key, and rent out the studio unit. But doing so, might need to rent outside during the transaction period.\n\nI have a few questions, should I engage an agent to help me do all these transactions and loan application or DIY?

Currently, lots of high-rise living folks facing maintenance fee problem, especially those not already new, ditched by developer, managed by own condo. \n\n4. Many moans for facing mismanaging jmb, not efficient, corruption, mis conduct, and also due to current market trend of everything&#39;s price also hike, and leads to drastic increase of management fee. Many already cant stand with it\n\n5. Then condo folk cabut go for outskirt landed, follow the sheep almost all go into the popular stratified community idea township. \n\n6. It is actually same kind of condo management idea, where everybody share share pay for the fancy facility. \n\n7. Who manage? OfCourse developer. But it is just for now and not forever, because what if in the future the developer charge kaw2 then what? Kick out the developer and form jmb to manage own self? \n\n8. Yes then go back to the condo management loop, all kind of mismanagement problem, fee hiking problem again.\n\n9. Now then what about individual title? Good? No need month month pay management fee? Yes, big saving, but no security, not save, property value drop. \n\n10. Look at SS2, why ppl willing to buy condo there at almost the same price of adjacent landed property? Thats why....\n\n11.

My salary is around 3400 basic before deductions, my monthly after deductions total is around 3600 to 3800 plus 750 rental income. \n\nMy family is living in a walk up flat in Sri Endah worth around 160k to 200k, and I have another one in Sri Kembangan worth around 200k above. I plan to sell that one, and get a loan to buy a 3 rooms lift apartment in KL with good convenience such as market, shops just on the ground floor, less than 1 hour drive to government hospital, train station. After we move in, we would be renting out the one we are living in then.\n\nAnother option is to sell both houses, get a dual key, and rent out the studio unit. But doing so, might need to rent outside during the transaction period.\n\nI have a few questions, should I engage an agent to help me do all these transactions and loan application or DIY? What will be the price difference? I can&#39;t afford to gamble on this, so I am more toward completed unit. Is this way more expensive? Is it near impossible for my income?","author":"samftrmd","pubDate":"Sat, 07 Dec 2024 10:48:06 +0800"}

There are alot of communities with makeshift guards (guarded only not gated) that are more affordable, within RM 800k range such as USJ, Menjalara, BU, Damansara, PJ. But wanted to have the ease of mind with gated. I understand a lot these places will be minimum 1.4 m above. Some of the examples I have found are SPK Harmoni next to DPC, Ara Idaman, Mutiara Homes and further away of course plenty in Setia Alam and Rimbayu.\n\nAlso looking at potential new developments ie. Kwasa Damansara. \n\nLooking for more info from the forumers who are well versed with the property scene in Klang Valley to share. \n\nThanks in advance&#33;","author":"Simply_Ed","pubDate":"Thu, 12 Dec 2024 12:47:53 +0800"}

(as per current situation, alot rent to foreigner, defaulter list also high, with some auction unit start showing too)\n\n\na very Optimistic scenario from me, purchase the house to stay/rent out, after 5 years, MO manage to renew lease to 50+30 = 80y, sell after 10y to earn handsome money.

Me and my contractor discussed with the owner and finally fixed those problems.\n\nBut now have other problems after a few months, I don&#39;t see anyone renovating his place, so the house is like abandoned, and becoming a sleeping place for the stray dogs, and according to my contractor, an abandoned house is actually very dangerous and might affect my house in the future.\n\n\nAnyone of you has such experience?

These launches are expected to receive positive responses from potential buyers and investors and be well-received by the market. \n\nTower B of Botanika and Phase 2 of Danga Sutera were both awarded the Certificate of Completion and Compliance (“CCC”) in August 2023 and October 2023, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n5 bedrooms &amp;

Do you guys rely on property agents or do you list on platforms like Mudah, PropertyGuru, or Facebook yourself? \n\nFor me, I will occasionally receive texts from agents asking if my property is for rent/sell (although I&#39;m not sure how they get my contact). So I&#39;ll just engage them to help find tenants or buyers. I wonder if you guys has any better approaches to find an agent that will really help you screen through tenants, or do you guys have any ways to look for buyers/tenants on your own?\n\nSincerely asking for tips 🙏","author":"Staywokeproperty","category":"Investment","pubDate":"Thu, 02 Jan 2025 18:50:01 +0800"}

(day dream)\n\nhow you all think? would you consider?","author":"woolei","category":"Household","pubDate":"Fri, 03 Jan 2025 15:17:06 +0800"}

I&#39;m about to sign a new agreement and noticed the agreement is 100% biased to owner. In the agreement, it says tenant is responsible to all the damage/breakdown in the unit including aircond, water heater, wc and etc. Their logic is if I hand over all things in working condition, tenant will be 100% liable to those things. I asked the agent and she said 180days warranty for heater, 30 days for AC and WC, 1 week for drain. Tenant will be fully responsible after those days, including replacing a new one if it happens to be not repairable. \n\nI think this is unfair and asked for some amendment. Then the agent just says owner does not want to rent to me anymore. Is this a common thing? If not, is there anything I can do, maybe legal action?","author":"kkl888","pubDate":"Mon, 27 Jan 2025 19:31:48 +0800"}
