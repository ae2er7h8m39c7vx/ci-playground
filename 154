Also considering other factors such as Landed Property expansions, Covid Recovery, RTS etc<br />I&#39;m not familiar with real estate market so I&#39;m genuinely asking what would the future trend of prices. I would like to use this info to decide to buy the subsale unit for own stay and possibly renting it out in the future if I ever decide to move back to KL. I&#39;m not desperate to buy a house as I&#39;ve already owned one and fully paid in KL. But if the monthly installment+maintenance is going to be at least equal to or less than the rental then I see why not to buy one. More so, the units look well-renovated and fully furnished.</i><br /><br /><b>CONTEXT<br /></b><br />I&#39;ve relocated from KL to Setia Tropika about 1.5 years ago and been renting here since in one of the apartments called Sky Garden Residence ( another neighbouring apartment Sky Peak Residence)<br />I love this place, a lot of shops within walking distance, right at PLUS exit, and within a 15-20mins drive to all major towns in Johor Metro (Kulai, Senai, Skudai, Dato Onn, Austin, Tebrau, Southkey, JB)<br />Also relaxing 15-30mins drive to/from work in Senai.<br /><br />2022 - I rented a 3+1, 1200 sqft unit, fully furnished, 2 car park unit for rm1300. for rental renewal, my landlord increased the rental to rm1700, He told me he had to because his instalment is very high (not my problem, lol). So I moved out to another unit in the same apartment.<br />2023 - 2+1, 1000 sqft, FF, 1 car park  - rm1500.<br />2024 - looking at the rental rate for the similar unit I have now, it seems like nothing less than rm1800, so I kind of have these feeling my current landlord will up the rental rate.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been looking at the sub-sale prices and it seems to be going down since 2022. My first rented unit was going for RM480K, even when I moved out my landlord offered me a similar rate and then went down to RM450K when I ignored the 1st offer. And this was in April 2023.<br />Currently, I&#39;ve been seeing these units going for RM420K. 2+1 units (similar to the one I&#39;m renting now) are going for RM380K. Neighbouring apartment Sky Peak seeing a similar trend, though it&#39;s slightly more expensive than Sky Garden.<br /><br /><b>Rental rates are going up but subsale prices are going down? Why?</b>[I]<br /><br />Now, I just saw that SP Setia going to build another apartment right between Sky Garden and Sky Peak. I checked with them, the max price will be RM550K for 3-bedroom units 850sqft.<br />There is another apartment across the PLUS highway called D&#39;Secret Garden 2 by KSL that is under construction, right next to 6-year-old D&#39;Secret Garden 1.","author":"Kakistok","pubDate":"Sun, 10 Dec 2023 15:07:37 +0800"}

Apparently, this husband (second husband) has history of abusing the wife, and this is the first time the wife reporting on her husband.<br /><br />Thank god the access card and keys are with the wife. Tenancy agreement is signed under the husband&#39;s name and the agreement is with the wife as well. She wants to change the agreement to her name. I have the rental and utilities deposit, but the deposit is transferred to me via the husband&#39;s account.

Business costs, political stability, and pro-business policies are the factors to take into account,&quot; he told NST Property.\n\n  Tan said that Mah Sing may be able to generate positive sales from its proposed development, given that the land is in an excellent location close to Lima Kedai, where there is a decent mix of low- to high-income groups.\n\n\n  Lima Kedai is a crucial transit hub for those using the Second Link Motorway.\n\n  According to Tan, there are numerous employment hubs in and near Pulai, including Southern Industrial Logistics and Clusters (SiLC), Nusajaya Tech Park, Tanjung Bin, and the Port of Tanjung Pelepas, which are increasing demand for houses.\n\n\n  Mah Sing paid RM 76.09 million, or RM23 per square foot (psf), for 30.63 hectares   (  75.68 acres)    in Pulai to expand its M-series.\n\n  It plans to introduce M Tiara, a community of \n\ndouble-storey cluster homes (32&#39;x70&#39;/75&#39;) and\n\n2240 sq ft\n\n\n double-storey terraced homes (20&#39;/22&#39;x70&#39;), \n\n\n1400 sq ft\n\n\nwith a gross development value (GDV) of RM480 million.\n\n\n\n\n  According to Mah Sing&#39;s statement yesterday, the most affordable residential units are anticipated to cost RM624,800.\n\n\nSo cheap ???????\n\n\n\n  The land acquisition is in line with Mah Sing&#39;s strategy of quick turnaround, as registration of interest is expected to be in the first half of 2024.\n\n  Tan said that the stated purchase price was reasonable.\n\n  &quot;Recent sales in Pulai ranged from RM20 to RM25 psf. We believe that the pricing of RM23 psf is suitable for Mah Sing to create its M-series,&quot; he added.\n\n  Analysts are particularly optimistic about Mah Sing&#39;s purchase of land in Pulai since it will allow the company to extend its M-series of affordable housing projects.\n\n  According to MIDF Research, the land cost to GDV is appealing at 16 per cent of the project&#39;s overall value.\n\n  Additionally, it anticipates a minimal impact on the balance sheet. \n\n  &quot;Post-acquisition, we estimate net gearing to increase marginally to 0.22 times from 0.2 times in the first quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, we do not foresee earnings impact in the near term as the project is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.\n\nHence, we make no changes to our earnings forecast,&quot; MIDF said in a note.\n\n  The research house has maintained its &quot;Buy&quot; call on Mah Sing with an unchanged target price of 75 sen.\n\n  It continues to be optimistic about Mah Sing, as it believes that new sales prospects for Mah Sing will be driven by the introduction of properties at reasonable prices. \n\n  The strategic location and affordable purchase price of the planned acquisition have TA Securities feeling optimistic as well. \n\n  The research firm said that in accordance with the anticipated GDV of RM480 million, the land cost accounts for 15.9 per cent  of the entire development value.\n\n  &quot;As the land cost to GDV ratio comes below the general rule of thumb of 20 per cent, we deem the acquisition price reasonable,&quot; it said.\n\n  The positive take-up rate of 85–95 per cent for Mah Sing&#39;s new launches in the first quarter of 2023, demonstrates the persistent demand for affordable housing in urban areas, according to TA Securities.\n\n<img src='https://i.ibb.co/M6TbQLQ/Screenshot-20240121-230514-Chrome.jpg' border='0' alt='user posted image' />","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Sun, 21 Jan 2024 23:10:31 +0800"}

The road in front of our house is actually one-way road (enough to fit one car), but because they used my driveway, so it become two-way (enough for two cars).\n\nBecause it has been like this for many years, so I don&#39;t think I can take it back to make fence, and it is not nice to neighbours too. So, can I get some compensation from Government as that piece of land is belong to my family and now has been used as public road?\n\nAny input are welcome, thanks a lot&#33;","author":"gsstars","pubDate":"Wed, 17 Jan 2024 17:02:12 +0800"}

Business costs, political stability, and pro-business policies are the factors to take into account,&quot; he told NST Property.\n\n  Tan said that Mah Sing may be able to generate positive sales from its proposed development, given that the land is in an excellent location close to Lima Kedai, where there is a decent mix of low- to high-income groups.\n\n\n  Lima Kedai is a crucial transit hub for those using the Second Link Motorway.\n\n  According to Tan, there are numerous employment hubs in and near Pulai, including Southern Industrial Logistics and Clusters (SiLC), Nusajaya Tech Park, Tanjung Bin, and the Port of Tanjung Pelepas, which are increasing demand for houses.\n\n\n  Mah Sing paid RM 76.09 million, or RM23 per square foot (psf), for 30.63 hectares   (  75.68 acres)    in Pulai to expand its M-series.\n\n  It plans to introduce M Tiara, a community of \n\ndouble-storey cluster homes (32&#39;x70&#39;/75&#39;) and\n\n2240 sq ft\n\n\n double-storey terraced homes (20&#39;/22&#39;x70&#39;), \n\n\n1400 sq ft\n\n\nwith a gross development value (GDV) of RM480 million.\n\n\n\n\n  According to Mah Sing&#39;s statement yesterday, the most affordable residential units are anticipated to cost RM624,800.\n\n\nSo cheap ???????\n\n\n\n  The land acquisition is in line with Mah Sing&#39;s strategy of quick turnaround, as registration of interest is expected to be in the first half of 2024.\n\n  Tan said that the stated purchase price was reasonable.\n\n  &quot;Recent sales in Pulai ranged from RM20 to RM25 psf. We believe that the pricing of RM23 psf is suitable for Mah Sing to create its M-series,&quot; he added.\n\n  Analysts are particularly optimistic about Mah Sing&#39;s purchase of land in Pulai since it will allow the company to extend its M-series of affordable housing projects.\n\n  According to MIDF Research, the land cost to GDV is appealing at 16 per cent of the project&#39;s overall value.\n\n  Additionally, it anticipates a minimal impact on the balance sheet. \n\n  &quot;Post-acquisition, we estimate net gearing to increase marginally to 0.22 times from 0.2 times in the first quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, we do not foresee earnings impact in the near term as the project is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.\n\nHence, we make no changes to our earnings forecast,&quot; MIDF said in a note.\n\n  The research house has maintained its &quot;Buy&quot; call on Mah Sing with an unchanged target price of 75 sen.\n\n  It continues to be optimistic about Mah Sing, as it believes that new sales prospects for Mah Sing will be driven by the introduction of properties at reasonable prices. \n\n  The strategic location and affordable purchase price of the planned acquisition have TA Securities feeling optimistic as well. \n\n  The research firm said that in accordance with the anticipated GDV of RM480 million, the land cost accounts for 15.9 per cent  of the entire development value.\n\n  &quot;As the land cost to GDV ratio comes below the general rule of thumb of 20 per cent, we deem the acquisition price reasonable,&quot; it said.\n\n  The positive take-up rate of 85–95 per cent for Mah Sing&#39;s new launches in the first quarter of 2023, demonstrates the persistent demand for affordable housing in urban areas, according to TA Securities.","author":"plouffle0789","pubDate":"Sun, 21 Jan 2024 23:10:31 +0800"}
